If you’ve ever tried reading anything out loud in French, you probably already know I’m talking about the frustration of silent letters in French. Even if it seems like someone simply picked a few too many letters out of a hat and called it a French word, silent letters, or&nbsp;lettres muettes, have a few rules. Hopefully, once you learn them, you’ll start to see the pattern behind all those unpronounced e’s and ignored endings. Then, you can feel a lot more confident when you read and speak French.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Sneaky-E’s>Sneaky E’s</h2><p>The French e has many different pronunciations, making it a source of frustration for many learners. Add in the silent e, or the&nbsp;e muet, and it might even feel like you’ll never understand it.</p><p>Let’s start with the basics.</p><p>Whenever the e sound is dropped from a word in French, it’s called an&nbsp;élision. Though, some of the rules regarding when&nbsp;élision&nbsp;is necessary, optional, or not used can be a little confusing.</p><p>The first thing you should remember is that a silent e will never have an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">accent</a>. In other words, if a word has an&nbsp;é, è, ê,&nbsp;or&nbsp;ë, make sure you pronounce it.</p><p>Second, most of the time, you’ll know an unaccented e should be silent because it comes at the end of a word, like in&nbsp;jusque&nbsp;or&nbsp;elle. This is especially true when a contraction occurs.</p><p>For example, a common contraction you might notice is&nbsp;c’est. The e in&nbsp;ce&nbsp;is dropped completely in this case. However, an exception to this rule is that whenever the word that follows the&nbsp;e muet&nbsp;begins with an&nbsp;h&nbsp;aspiré, it’s no longer silent, such as with&nbsp;ce hamburger.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Stealthy-H’s>Stealthy H’s</h2><p>H aspiré? What’s that?</p><p>Both&nbsp;h aspiré&nbsp;and&nbsp;h muet&nbsp;are silent h’s. The difference is that the h aspiré does not allow for contractions, while the&nbsp;h muet&nbsp;does.</p><p>For example, let’s look at the words&nbsp;j’habite&nbsp;(I live) and&nbsp;je hais&nbsp;(I hate). When you speak French, you don’t pronounce the h in either set of words. It’s silent.</p><p>However, the verb&nbsp;habiter&nbsp;begins with an&nbsp;h muet&nbsp;while the verb&nbsp;haïr&nbsp;begins with an&nbsp;h aspiré, which means the e in&nbsp;je&nbsp;does not contract. So, you’ll have to watch both your pronunciation and spelling.</p><p>But how do you know which words have an&nbsp;h aspiré? Unfortunately, the best way is to make note of it when you&nbsp;<a href=#>learn new vocabulary words</a>.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Wait,-what-ending?>Wait, what ending?</h2><p>It wouldn’t be so bad if e’s and h’s were the only letters you didn’t pronounce in French. But let’s not forget about the most frustrating silent letters of all: the final consonants.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">French learners</a> will already know that the last few letters of many French words simply aren’t pronounced. If you want a few examples, just start conjugating almost any French verb (Je&nbsp;parle&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ils parlent&nbsp;?)</p><p>Still, that doesn’t mean that there aren’t plenty of exceptions either. There are a few consonants that are usually pronounced at the end of French words. These are B, C, F, K, L, R, and Q.</p><p>An easy way to remember the most common ones is by remembering the word&nbsp;<strong>CaReFuL</strong>. Whenever you encounter the letters C, R, F, and L at the end of a word, you should be careful because you probably need to pronounce them. Luckily, there aren’t as many French words that end with B, K, or Q.</p><p>Of course, there are still exceptions to this rule. If there weren’t, it wouldn’t be so difficult to figure out.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why does French have so many silent letters?</h2><p>Ultimately, the only way to be sure of your French spelling and pronunciation is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">practice</a>, but by remembering these tips about silent letters in French, you have a good chance of being correct, which means you won’t have to feel so discouraged.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/lingoda-2020-favicon.png><h2>Cassie Wright</h2><p>Cassie Wright is a freelance writer and blogger living in the United States. After a bad experience with elementary school Spanish classes, she fell in love with learning French. Now, in addition to French, she spends a considerable amount of time learning Japanese and has jumped back into learning Spanish. Like many avid language learners, she plans to continue learning more languages than she has hours in the day. When she isn’t writing or learning, she loves reading, traveling, video games, and all forms of chocolate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbXNoKadmV6YvK57waWmoGeVo3ylu82tZKmqn6O8trrCnmSsoZyau7V5y56rrZ2iqHqnvsSnmqFn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
