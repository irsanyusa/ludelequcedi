The Couchlet nests between cushions.</p><p>Having trouble reaching your charger from the bed? The Couchlet™ has a folding arm that wedges under your mattress.</p><p>The Couchlet’s wedge-shaped design means that it fits between or under cushions and mattresses so that you can barely even see it. The fold out leg gives you extra stability and the ability to slide the Couchlet™ onto the outside of your furniture.</p><p>Each Couchlet comes with a detachable 6-foot USB cable that uses your current wall charger for power. The Couchlet is low voltage, so it’s just as safe as the charging cord that comes with your phone.”</p><p>Hawker also goes on to describe how the new innovation came to be and the thought process behind it:</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“When we were brainstorming product opportunities, we realized that all of us have experienced cramped muscles, awkward stretching and texting with our phone two feet from our face. A few of us had even rigged up an elaborate system of cords or power strips in our couch and on our bed. We knew there had to be a better way to solve this issue. It needed to be sturdy, compatible with any device, have a long cord, and be slim and easy to slide in between seat cushions. Thus the Couchlet was born!”</p><p>The Couchlet shows a promise of very practical everyday use and would go a long in resolving some the issues people commonly face when it comes to charging up their devices.</p><p>It starts shipping in December, 2015.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0mirnpuYZK%2Bmv9NmmqGZopy2r7OMrKeorF2eu7W%2Bzp2snKGenHqku9Scn6WdpGLBqbGMqaawnaJivLbAy56rZqGeYsawwdFmmqitk518er%2FQrKSscQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
