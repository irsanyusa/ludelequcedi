I want to start by saying I (38M) love my family and wife (35F), and I have never been the type to do anything like this before.
12 months ago, my wife gave up eating meat."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Hidden from view, his clandestine meals became a&nbsp;secret rebellion against the rigid dietary restrictions that he&nbsp;felt were imposed on&nbsp;him. This is&nbsp;the story of&nbsp;how he&nbsp;navigated the tension between personal cravings and the expectations of&nbsp;a&nbsp;vegetarian household.</p><p>I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;start by&nbsp;saying&nbsp;I (38M) love my&nbsp;family and wife (35F), and&nbsp;I have never been the type to&nbsp;do&nbsp;anything like this before.</p><p>12&nbsp;months ago, my&nbsp;wife gave up&nbsp;eating meat. The whole family (me&nbsp;and our two young boys) were supportive of&nbsp;this, and we&nbsp;held a&nbsp;vegetarian-only dinner that night as&nbsp;a&nbsp;little sign of&nbsp;support.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/919/298/a7305456b29d1106a293c9e1e1.jpg><p>Life continues for another ~8 months basically unchanged; the boys and&nbsp;I eat meat, and my&nbsp;wife doesn’t. However, things start to&nbsp;change around that 8-10 month marker (can’t remember exactly). Basically, along with not eating meat, my&nbsp;wife now no&nbsp;longer wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;around&nbsp;it. This wasn’t the only thing. Things continue to&nbsp;progress. Basically, my&nbsp;wife started to&nbsp;replace things in&nbsp;the house with substitutes.</p><p>First, the pork in&nbsp;the house was swapped out for Jackfruit, eggs were swapped out for substitutes like Just Egg, shirts were only bought from clean brands like Plant Faced Clothing, and Deodorants were swapped out for deodorant pills like GoScentless&nbsp;— you get the idea.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2ea/102/a6ffdc5cf2ad2ac3da1b77656e.jpg><p>To&nbsp;say this was creating a&nbsp;rift would be&nbsp;an&nbsp;understatement, and eventually, I&nbsp;brought up&nbsp;to&nbsp;our wife that again, while we&nbsp;100% support her in&nbsp;her decisions around these things, I&nbsp;didn’t think it&nbsp;should change things for the boys and&nbsp;me (unless of&nbsp;course, they wanted&nbsp;it). My&nbsp;wife argued that her values had changed and that being around some of&nbsp;this stuff was really hard for her, and wanted&nbsp;us to&nbsp;support her.</p><p>For the next 2–3&nbsp;months, the house was a&nbsp;place of&nbsp;pretty high tension. It&nbsp;had gotten so&nbsp;bad that the boys had friends bringing them meat from their houses, since it&nbsp;was now completely gone from ours.</p><p>Anyway, about a&nbsp;week ago my&nbsp;wife went away on&nbsp;a&nbsp;few days-long business trip&nbsp;— meaning&nbsp;I was watching the boys Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. Basically, and I’m a&nbsp;bit ashamed to&nbsp;type this out&nbsp;— but the boys and&nbsp;I mostly ate meat, basically every chance we&nbsp;got. This was all fine and dandy; the boys and&nbsp;I had a&nbsp;great time&nbsp;— until my&nbsp;wife returned home, and it&nbsp;somehow slipped out what we&nbsp;had done. I&nbsp;have never seen her so&nbsp;disappointed in&nbsp;us.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/542/eda/5b6dbe58ee9dfa34d07d896f45.jpg><p>After putting the boys to&nbsp;bed, we&nbsp;argued for hours about how&nbsp;I was setting a&nbsp;poor example for the boys, that&nbsp;I should respect the decisions made by&nbsp;my&nbsp;wife, even if&nbsp;they’re “tough” and “inconvenient”.</p><p>It’s hard to&nbsp;argue back because&nbsp;I can see her side, but it&nbsp;boils down simply to&nbsp;just&nbsp;I don’t want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;vegetarian/vegan, and neither do&nbsp;the boys.</p><p><h2>People stood on&nbsp;his side.</h2></p><ul><li>“She said she got rid of&nbsp;it&nbsp;because she couldn’t be&nbsp;around&nbsp;it... well, she wasn’t around&nbsp;it.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>WaryScientist&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“Your wife is&nbsp;the bad guy for FORCING her family to&nbsp;follow the same beliefs as&nbsp;she does.

She is&nbsp;100% wrong for that.<br>You need to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;harder stance and let her know this ’support’ she wants comes with a&nbsp;cost.
