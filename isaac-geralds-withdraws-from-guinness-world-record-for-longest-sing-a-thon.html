His commitment to supporting children with autism and their families remains as strong as ever."</p><p>Geralds' sing-a-thon was for a good cause. He planned to raise $500,000 and awareness for children with autism through this singing marathon that took place in Washington, D.C. The funds were to support The Children's National Hospital in DC and the Efe Irele Autism Foundation in Nigeria, two organisations providing care and support to the autism community.</p><p>Interestingly, in 2023, a Ghanaian woman, <strong>Afua Asantewaa,</strong> attempted to break the record for the longest singing marathon by singing for 126 hours and 52 minutes. However, she was disqualified by Guinness World Records.</p><p>Before the attempt, Isaac was a finalist in season 4 of MTN Project Fame and released his debut album, <strong>Love and Heartbreak</strong>, alongside superstars like <strong>Tiwa Savage</strong> and <strong>Ladipoe</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmq6uZppq5cLXSmpicZZeav6K4w6xksKGknbGzrdasZJ%2Bqn6J6qMHIp6Weq6NixLC%2By51kq52TpL%2BlecWoqWakn6O0pr%2FTZqqippdirm7Ax6ilaKOjoLV2vtM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
