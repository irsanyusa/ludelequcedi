Back then, society’s standards pretty much dictated their decision-making, and many people had offspring just because it&nbsp;was the right thing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;and not because they wanted&nbsp;to.</p><p>Even though celebrities are in&nbsp;the center of&nbsp;the public eye and are easily criticized, these 10&nbsp;actors still decided to&nbsp;share why they chose not to&nbsp;have kids, and we&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> appreciate their honesty.</p><p><h2>1. Jon Hamm</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/44e/950/24c97f5ed8a99f8d676858ff9d.jpg><p>The <i>Mad Man</i> actor has plenty of&nbsp;friends with kids, and he&nbsp;can’t believe it&nbsp;when he&nbsp;sees that even after so&nbsp;many responsibilities, they still manage to&nbsp;stay upright and be&nbsp;at&nbsp;work at&nbsp;6&nbsp;AM. “I&nbsp;would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;terrible dad,” Hamm <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a>. “I&nbsp;never thought I’d be&nbsp;this age and not have kids. But the chance that&nbsp;I and my&nbsp;wife will regret it&nbsp;doesn’t seem like a&nbsp;compelling enough reason to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it.”</p><p><h2>2. Miley Cyrus</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/515/3ea/160a3e5678b24a4e3d89ddba8f.jpg><p>MICHAEL TRAN/AFP/East News</p><p><a href=# title="Miley Cyrus" data-link=tag>Miley Cyrus</a> revealed that she doesn’t want to&nbsp;bring a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>child</a> into this world because of&nbsp;the environmental issues our planet is&nbsp;facing. “Until I&nbsp;feel like my&nbsp;kid would live on&nbsp;an&nbsp;earth with fish in&nbsp;the water, I’m not bringing in&nbsp;another person to&nbsp;deal with that.”</p><p><h2>3. Alison Brie</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/518/a3a/7eb8575ed6be9a8f666e2e9e21.jpg><p>She and her husband, Dave Franco, decided not to&nbsp;have <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>children</a> because it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;too stressful. “I&nbsp;don’t really want to&nbsp;have kids. It’s great because&nbsp;I don’t worry about when&nbsp;I should get pregnant&nbsp;— between seasons, while we’re shooting the show&nbsp;— I&nbsp;don’t think about it&nbsp;every day.”</p><p>In&nbsp;one interview, Alison Brie also joked on&nbsp;their behalf that they already have 2&nbsp;children&nbsp;— referring to&nbsp;their cats, Harry and Arturo. “I&nbsp;think about how much we’re involved in&nbsp;our cats’ lives. Oh&nbsp;my&nbsp;God, what if&nbsp;it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;child!”</p><p><h2>4. Renée Zellweger</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7c8/f7d/797f555331947c41e50eeec4a3.jpg><p>JEAN-BAPTISTE LACROIX/AFP/East News</p><p>Renée Zellweger revealed that she never plans what her life is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;like&nbsp;— she just takes things as&nbsp;they come. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a> that the same implies whether or&nbsp;not she is&nbsp;having a&nbsp;child: “Motherhood has never been an&nbsp;ambition. I&nbsp;just want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;independent and be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;myself. Anything else is&nbsp;just gravy.”</p><p><h2>5. Tracee Ellis Ross</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/267/b79/f84556508a82d5ad8dbeff4f59.jpg><p>The<i> Black-ish</i> star thinks that there are too many babies in&nbsp;the world and that it’s part of&nbsp;the problem. “Some people could be&nbsp;working on&nbsp;the world being a&nbsp;better place, or&nbsp;just being happy,” she pointed out.</p><p>Even though getting married and having children for Ross is&nbsp;not off the table, she wants to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;on&nbsp;her own terms and not when society believes it’s the right time. “I’m constantly asking myself questions, reminding myself, ’Are you making that decision for you or&nbsp;someone else?’” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a>.</p><p><h2>6. Keanu Reeves</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/97e/7a1/bec9a2565280be826ec4cf64ce.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the past, Reeves had the desire to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;father. However, luck wasn’t on&nbsp;his side, and his then-girlfriend Jennifer Syme gave birth to&nbsp;a&nbsp;stillborn. The loss of&nbsp;their unborn child took a&nbsp;toll on&nbsp;their relationship, and they broke up&nbsp;only a&nbsp;few weeks later.</p><p>Since then, Reeves didn’t have any serious relationships, and in&nbsp;2017, when he&nbsp;was asked if&nbsp;he&nbsp;plans to&nbsp;have kids, his response <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>was</a>, “I’m too old. It’s too late.”</p><p><h2>7. Kim Cattrall</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/df4/d63/8bb84f5237a230141716bb25d9.jpg><p>When <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Kim Cattrall</a> was 5&nbsp;years old, she fantasized about having a&nbsp;hundred dogs and a&nbsp;hundred kids. But she wasn’t having luck in&nbsp;finding a&nbsp;partner and realized that if&nbsp;she wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;mom, she should do&nbsp;it&nbsp;on&nbsp;her own. But with all the DNA choices she was provided, she simply couldn’t see becoming a&nbsp;parent that way. She wanted a&nbsp;product of&nbsp;a&nbsp;union with someone she loves, and the only pressure she felt about becoming a&nbsp;mother was from outside sources.</p><p>At&nbsp;age 44, Cattrall considered having babies with her third husband, Mark Levinson. She wanted to&nbsp;start IVF treatment, but at&nbsp;the time, she was filming <i>Sex and the City</i> and realized that a&nbsp;child wouldn’t fit into her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>schedule</a>.</p><p><h2>8. Betty White</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b3a/d20/32b4085cb69976b4b364d1480f.jpg><p>Betty White knew that if&nbsp;she had children, all her focus will fall on&nbsp;them. But she chose not to&nbsp;have kids because she wanted to&nbsp;only focus on&nbsp;her <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a> and believed that, as&nbsp;compulsive as&nbsp;she was, she wasn’t going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>both</a>. And the good thing&nbsp;is, she never regretted her decision. Even though she never had biological children, she was blessed with 3&nbsp;stepchildren.</p><p><h2>9. Portia de&nbsp;Rossi</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3ce/df7/f38c6b566085dc86a69b165cbb.jpg><p>In&nbsp;her thirties, Portia de&nbsp;Rossi felt pressure about becoming a&nbsp;mother because her biological clock was ticking. And since she wasn’t so&nbsp;sure that she wanted to&nbsp;have any children, she asked herself a&nbsp;question: “Am&nbsp;I&nbsp;going to&nbsp;have kids, so&nbsp;I don’t miss out on&nbsp;something that other people really seem to&nbsp;love? Or&nbsp;is&nbsp;it&nbsp;that&nbsp;I really genuinely want to&nbsp;do&nbsp;this with my&nbsp;whole heart?”</p><p>Her answer to&nbsp;the second question wasn’t yes, so&nbsp;she decided to&nbsp;not have <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>kids</a>.</p><p><h2>10. Anjelica Huston</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/44a/c06/bed1b355949a66f40f0004b975.jpg><p>ANGELA WEISS/AFP/East News</p><p>Anjelica Huston revealed that there have been <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>times</a> in&nbsp;her life when she wanted to&nbsp;have kids, but there were also times when she was grateful not to&nbsp;have them. She’s so&nbsp;connected to&nbsp;her dog that she’s a&nbsp;mess whenever she has to&nbsp;be&nbsp;away from&nbsp;it, and she doesn’t know how she would deal if&nbsp;she had to&nbsp;kiss her kids goodbye to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;work. “I&nbsp;would probably have been miserable,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you think you made the right decision to&nbsp;have or&nbsp;not to&nbsp;have children?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5xecKeo56aop7BqrHSZqqpp5uaeqm7zZ6qraSpYq6ju9StZLCgqWLBqbHYZpqhp6Oaeq%2B702arqGWYlsOmecqim6xlaGWFdX6XaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
