Here are our picks for the 50 greatest video games of all time.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=# rel=noopener>How the Super Nintendo still influences video games</a></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">50. <a href=# rel=noopener>King’s Quest III: To Heir Is Human</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-kings-quest-3.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the 1980s, the years that led up to Nintendo’s reign were dominated by PC titles, and of these none were better imagined than Sierra’s. When honoring their adventure line, critics typically laud the original King’s Quest. But it’s the third installment released in 1986 that deserves the most acclaim, because it was also twice as big as the first two installments, and as clever as any in the series. Following the adventures of Daventry’s 17-year-old Prince Alexander, the game hit closer to home with its primary players, who like it or not were pretty much boys. Yet despite the outmoded graphics (or maybe because of them), the keyboard-controlled adventure is still a joy to play (<a href=# rel=noopener>try it yourself</a>). From amassing all the ingredients to make potions, to avoiding the wizard’s evil black cat, to stealing the pirate’s treasure, it’s pure magic.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Get it now</strong></a></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">49. <a href=# rel=noopener>Dota 2</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-video-games-dota-2.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The improbable sequel to <a href=# rel=noopener>a fan mod</a> for <a href=# rel=noopener>a Blizzard game</a> that came out in 2002, Dota 2 stormed the e-sports scene in 2013 with its sophisticated twist on real-time resource management and turf control. Arguably the pinnacle of the multiplayer online battle arena genre (or MOBA, which is just another way of saying “competitive real-time strategy game”), it sees two teams of five jockey for sway over lush, jungled terrain beset by ever-spawning computer armies, locking horns at a river that cuts diagonally across a symmetric map. Difficult to master but thrilling to watch, Dota 2 matches unfold like frenetic attention-deficit sprees, camera views pinballing around battlefields flush with antagonists converging on dozens of flashpoints, as players battle to demolish the other team’s “ancient.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Play it now</strong></a></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">48. <a href=# rel=noopener>Angry Birds</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-angry-birds.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Rovio’s debut 2009 mobile game, now one of the most recognizable franchises in the world, definitely benefitted from being one of the earliest titles for the iPhone. But the studio’s quirky avian-flinging physics puzzler—players have to slingshot roly-poly birds at likewise rotund, entrenched pigs—also honed in on key elements of smartphone gaming’s then-nascent purview: bite-sized levels for on-the-go play, easy to pickup (if grueling to master) gameplay, and eventually a free-to-play biz model built on micro-transactions. It’s safe to say Angry Birds established the template for all the untold numbers of mobile games vying for our e-wallets since.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Play it now</strong></a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#><i>Get the latest deals, reviews and recommendations from the editors of TIME: sign up for The Goods newsletter here</i></a></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">47. <a href=# rel=noopener>Guitar Hero</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-guitar-hero.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>Guitar Hero</a> reanimated the music video game genre when it launched in 2005, magically transmogrifying players into bona fide fret-shredding, tremolo-slapping Rock Gods. Sure, you had to provide your own sweatbands, eyeliner and hair extensions. But for the price of the game and its eponymous accessory, players hammering buttons on faux guitars were able to rhythmically glimpse what it might feel like to be a Stevie Ray Vaughan or Jake E. Lee. While games like Dance Dance Revolution had proven popular with smaller audiences, it was Guitar Hero‘s rolling collection of classic and modern rock anthems that drove it to mainstream accolades (to say nothing of all the impromptu house parties).</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Get it now</strong></a></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">46. <a href=# rel=noopener>Resident Evil 4</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-video-games-resident-evil-4.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Who can forget the moment they first shot the face off a possessed farmer in <a href=# rel=noopener>Resident Evil 4</a>, only to conjure a lively Lovecraftian horror with tentacles squirming from its neck? This was Resident Evil reborn, its creaky fixed perspectives and klutzy directional controls supplanted by a freer over-the-shoulder, shoot-first perspective that felt at once elegant and intuitive. Instead of cheap haunted house scares in claustrophobic spaces, the story shifted to organic exploration of delightfully creepy areas, punctuated by frenzied scrambles to fend off the series’ most inspired adversaries. Capcom’s timely embrace in 2005 of action-oriented principles stole nothing from the game’s cheerless ambience, and actually amplified the sense of trudging through a phantasmagoric nightmare.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Get it now</strong></a></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">45: <a href=# rel=noopener>Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-video-games-gran-turismo-3.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As Microsoft Flight Simulator to the flight sim genre, so Polyphony Digital’s Gran Turismo series to hi-fi motorsport hot-rodding. Of all the Gran Turismo games, 2001’s Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec for the PlayStation 2 remains the series’ apotheosis, a madly ambitious encyclopedia of lovingly modeled vehicles and vistas surpassing the wildest gear nut fantasies. Here was a racing game to rule all others, that on its surface promised endless championship events framed by thrillingly realistic physics and painstakingly replicated visuals, but that also catered to armchair grease monkeys, who might spend hours fine-tuning then gawking at their drop-dead gorgeous rides.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Get it now</strong></a></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">44. <a href=# rel=noopener>Super Smash Bros.</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-video-games-super-smash-bros.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Since the original launched on the Nintendo 64 in 1999, the <a href=# rel=noopener>Super Smash Bros. games</a> have become no-brainers for Nintendo fans. The game, which borrows from Nintendo’s stable of iconic characters, introduced something radical to the fighter genre: Rather than pounding the bejesus out of your opponents until they bow out, you’re basically playing an elaborate variant of <a href=# rel=noopener>King of the Hill</a>, trying to successfully knock your enemies off platforms in a given stage. What’s more, players could romp through stages freely, expanding the canvas upon which to doll out whuppings. And unlike other fighters that require players memorize arcane buttons combos to execute a character’s special maneuvers, Super Smash Bros. employs the same button template for everyone, making pickup simpler, and mastery about learning how best to synthesize all of the above.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Get it now</strong></a></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">43. <a href=# rel=noopener>Call of Duty 2</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-call-of-duty-2.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Call of Duty franchise epitomizes everything a modern first-person shooter ought to be: A game with a compelling, story-driven single-player campaign along with a multiplayer mode that can steal hours of your life. The newer incarnations are more complex and prettier, of course. But they owe a great debt to Call of Duty 2, which in 2005 took what made the original title great and doubled down. Grand cinematic sequences gave players a sense of scope, while the realism—fallen soldiers would sometimes try fruitlessly to crawl to safety—drove home the horrors of war. Iron sights on the guns, meanwhile, made this a favorite of hyper-accurate PC gamers.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Get it now</strong></a></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">42. <a href=# rel=noopener>BioShock</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-video-games-bioshock.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>BioShock‘s</a> gripping metaphysical plot, over-the-top art deco levels and motley cast of hauntingly broken personas intermingle to furnish an experience so riveting and simultaneously disturbing that it fueled (at the time perfectly reasonable) conversations about games as more than dopamine-fueled diversions. Studio Irrational Games’ 2007 first-person shooter takes the player on an imaginative journey through the fictional undersea city of Rapture, built by fanatical industrialist Andrew Ryan (whose name references Atlas Shrugged novelist and self-described objectivist Ayn Rand). The game set new standards for video games on so many levels, from its horrifying forms of self-augmentation, to its ecology of intersectional enemy behaviors and its sublime ways of channeling what amounted to a withering deconstruction of extremist modes of thought.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Get it now</strong></a></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">41. <a href=# rel=noopener>ESPN NFL 2K5</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-espn-nfl-2k5.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sorry, Madden NFL fans, true football gaming fanatics know this is the best gridiron game ever made. Released in 2004 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, ESPN NFL 2K5 featured a standout franchise-building mode and in-game on-air talent from the eponymous sports network. It also marked a watershed moment in sports gaming lore: Publisher Sega priced the game at just $19.99, a fraction of what EA was charging for Madden NFL at the time. A frightened EA later scooped up the exclusive rights to the NFL and its players, making Madden the only name in town.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Get it now</strong></a></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">40. <a href=# rel=noopener>Pong</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-video-games-pong.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Snicker all you want about its two-dimensional graphics, Pong deserves a slot on this list because, as the first arcade cabinet to catch fire with the mainstream, it’s arguably most responsible for the modern video gaming phenomenon. A table tennis simulator developed by Atari and first released in 1972, the multiplayer game consisted of a pair of dial-controlled paddles and a bouncing ball—just enough to qualify it as the first sports video game. The popularity of the arcade version led to an in-home setup that was sold by Sears in 1975. And when imitators including Coleco and Nintendo followed, the first shots were fired in the console wars. Sure, by today’s standards it’s not as riveting as others on this list, but then that largely depends on who you’re playing against.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Get it now</strong></a></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">39. <a href=# rel=noopener>Castlevania</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-video-games-castlevania.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Pushing the limits of the NES’s 8-bit architecture, 1987’s Castlevania was a monster of a game, with stirring graphics, sophisticated physics (for such an early platformer) and unforgettable music that perfectly matched the title’s creepy feel. While nowhere as frightening as the yet-to-surface survival horror genre, it offered an experience in stark contrast to Nintendo’s whimsical Super Mario games. Exploring Dracula’s castle as vampire hunter Simon Belmont, players ran into some pretty haggard stuff. Bloodstained gates greet players off the bat, holy water and crosses were throwing weapons, and, oh yeah, you have to beat Death—and that’s not even the final boss.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Get it now</strong></a></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">38.<a href=# rel=noopener> Portal 2</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-video-games-portal-2.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Portal‘s unexpected balance of wit, dark comedy and captivating, reality-bending puzzles made it a surprise hit in 2007. Its sequel, <a href=# rel=noopener>Portal 2</a>, built on that success by adding additional polish and puzzles that were more involved and complex when it launched in 2011. 3 million copies of Portal 2 were reportedly sold within three months of the game’s launch, proving that the franchise had turned into much more than just a casual puzzle game.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Get it now</strong></a></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">37. <a href=# rel=noopener>Braid</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-video-games-braid.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Jonathan Blow’s elliptical time-bending 2008 side-scroller was for many a tale of heartbreak and disruption that touched on various cultural grievances. Blow <a href=# rel=noopener>pushed back</a>, suggesting such interpretations were too simplistic. Whatever the case, <a href=# rel=noopener>Braid</a> plays like nothing else, the act of a mind capable of magisterially subverting conventional design ideas and player expectations while embedding concepts as grand as the nature of reality in the gameplay itself. No Man’s Sky co-creator Sean Murray <a href=#>compares Braid to a time machine</a>: “It’s like Blow went back to the aesthetic of the late ‘80s and created a rift in time, like an alternate universe where we’d have gone in a different direction. Because <i>Braid</i> could have existed on the Amiga, and at the time it would have blown people’s minds. It would have completely changed how games developed.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Get it now</strong></a></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">36. <a href=# rel=noopener>Fallout 3</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-fallout-3.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Interplay’s original Fallout arrived like a cloudburst after a PC roleplaying drought in the mid-1990s. But it took IP newcomer Bethesda’s application of exhaustive, obsessively traditional roleplaying ideals tempered in its fantasy Elder Scrolls games to craft an experience in 2008 that surpassed the original in virtually every way. Both vast yet densely textured, packed with unforgettable characters and ethical nuance, sonically bleak yet whimsically tuneful once you found the right radio station–<a href=# rel=noopener>Fallout 3</a> showed us what a haunting and freewheeling post-apocalyptic masterpiece could look like.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Get it now</strong></a></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">35. <a href=# rel=noopener>Galaga</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-video-games-galaga.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">What’s the plot of Galaga? Who cares: You’ve got a bunch of quarters, and you want to blast a bunch of aliens. Released stateside in 1981, Galaga is the exemplar of the arcade’s golden age, a simple shoot-em-up where the only objective is to beat the other jerks’ high scores. (Serious players know the trick is to let the aliens tractor-beam your ship, then blast it free with another life, thereby getting double the firepower.) It’s one of the few old-school arcade games that’s still just as much fun to play today, thereby passing the often cruel test of time.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Get it now</strong></a></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">34. <a href=# rel=noopener>Red Dead Redemption</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-red-dead-redemption.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>Red Dead Redemption‘s</a> gorgeous high plains and scrub-filled landscapes, multilayered missions and sprawling story told with both the verve of a Leone and introspection of a Peckinpah, are just a few of the reasons Rockstar’s 2010 open-world opus deserves top honors on this list. The player follows former outlaw John Marston through an imagined, at times hallucinatory version of the West (circa 1911), where sudden gun duels and galloping chases ensue, counterbalanced by less treacherous diversions like herding cattle or playing mini-games like <a href=# rel=noopener>five finger fillet</a>. Yes, it was Grand Theft Auto meets a Western, but in a way that proved Rockstar’s mettle as far more than mere mischievous satire-slinger.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Get it now</strong></a></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">33. <a href=# rel=noopener>Super Mario Kart</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-games-super-mario-kart.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Transforming competitive racing into zany fruit-tossing fun, Super Mario Kart was much more than one of the smartest-looking games on the Super Nintendo. As the first in what would become a dynastic line of racers, this 1992 gem was full of kart-racing firsts: a circuit mode with varying degrees of difficulty, a split-screen versus mode so you could take on your friends and a battle mode to break up the monotony of straightforward sprints. And Super Mario Kart <a href=# rel=noopener>launched the series</a> to a rocket start with memorable tracks like Rainbow Road, expert tactics like drifting and maddening equalizers like the lightning bolt.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Get it now</a></strong></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">32. <a href=# rel=noopener>Wolfenstein 3D</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-video-games-castle-wolfenstein1.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Achtung! If Doom is the father of modern first-person shooters, Wolfenstein 3D is their granddaddy. Made by id Software and released shortly before Doom in May 1992, Wolfenstein 3D cast players as William “B.J.” Blazkowicz, an Allied spy captured by Nazis in World War II. As Blazkowicz, your job is simple: Escape from Castle Wolfenstein and shoot a bunch of bad guys in the process, which was (and remains) the definition of “thoughtless catharsis”—words that to this day define so much of Wolfenstein 3D‘s progeny.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Get it now</strong></a></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">31. <a href=# rel=noopener>The Sims</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-video-games-thesims.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Game designer Will Wright has said <a href=# rel=noopener>The Sims</a>, first released in 2000, was intended as a satire of American consumer culture. Millions of players seem to have missed the joke, happily occupying themselves with the mundane tasks of running a digital minion’s life—from kitting out a new pad to managing bathroom breaks (or else). It innovated both the “sandbox” category of game in which “goals” are loosely (or not at all) defined, as well as the kind of minutely detailed task management that’s a common feature of so many games today.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Get it now</strong></a></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">30. <a href=# rel=noopener>Pokemon Red & Blue</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-video-games-pokemon.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For many growing up in the 1990s, the Pokémon craze was unavoidable. And when Pokémon Red and Blue launched in 1998, those franchise-obsessed kids were given the chance to start a critter-filled adventure of their own–one they’d only to that point experienced through TV shows, toys and trading card games. Red and Blue also had all the hallmarks of a strong roleplaying game: addictive turn-based battles, a seemingly endless goal (to catch ’em all), plenty of attainable yet rewarding goals (earning gym badges, leveling up) and an expansive, uncharacteristically friendly world. The games also managed a feat all-too-rare in the games industry: a setup simple enough to appeal to children, but with layers of strategic depth sufficient to hook adults as well.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Get it now</strong></a></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">29. <a href=# rel=noopener>Myst</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-video-games-myst.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Myst is a perfect example of a monumentally influential game that would be almost excruciatingly painful to play today. The 1993 graphical adventure famously let players loose—sort of, since it consisted of a slow-loading series of beautifully rendered photos—on a mysterious island. Despite its now-clunky mechanics, it established an entirely new kind of fiction whose influence can be felt in everything from mythic sci-fi novels to the ABC television show Lost.

After dominating the golden age of arcades, Donkey Kong went on to have a massive influence on future Nintendo titles, ranging from the NES’s Ice Climber to the Wii U’s New Super Mario Bros. U. Even today, demanding expert timing and patience, it remains a timeless joy to play.

Gore isn’t an afterthought to your blows in this 1992 brawler, it’s the main spectacle. Mortal Kombat and the controversy it stirred were crucial in shifting the video game market from one that was evidently aimed at kids, to one that could appeal to teens and young adults.

That, of course, was before Microsoft acquired the studio and turned Halo into the definitive 2001 Xbox launch title, simultaneously proving shooters could work brilliantly on gamepads. Set on a mysterious artificial ring-world, players take up as Master Chief, a faceless, futuristic soldier fighting the alien Covenant and, later, the zombie-like Flood. The single-player campaign offered a gripping storyline that brought plot to the fore for one of the first times in a mainstream shooter, though some grumbled about its repetitive level design. The multiplayer, meanwhile, offered one of the finest such experiences of any shooter in history, replete with sniper rifles, sticky grenades, vehicles and other twists.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Get it now</strong></a></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">24. <a href=# rel=noopener>Final Fantasy VII</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-video-games-final-fantasy-vii.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While some would vote Final Fantasy VI the better game, 1997’s <a href=# rel=noopener>Final Fantasy VII</a> is arguably the bolder one in this anything-but-final roleplaying series.

A heart-pounding single-player campaign let gamers slip on the (doubtless immaculately tailored) shoes of the man with a license to kill. But as with other shooters on this list, multiplayer is where GoldenEye truly shines. Grenades bounce off walls, golden guns perform single shot kills, and cheaters prefer <a href=# rel=noopener>Oddjob</a> because he’s a smaller target.

Released in 1980, it delivered the player into an extraordinarily rich and vivid universe, despite its total lack of graphics. To this day the opening lines induce waking hallucinations in old-school gamers: “You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door. There is a small mailbox here.” What made Zork work, aside from its homespun, minimalist eloquence and self-referential wit (it was full of sly references to, among other things, Colossal Cave Adventure), was its eerily advanced text parser, which accepted commands from the player in plain English and turned them into actions in the game. Zork’s influence on later adventure games can’t be overstated—as an homage, the entirety of Zork was inserted into Call of Duty: Black Ops as an Easter egg.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">19. <a href=# rel=noopener>Space Invaders</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-video-games-space-invaders.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Influenced by the outer space-obsessed late 1970s, this early arcade shooter was a landmark in the early video game invasion.

In pop culture terms, it captivated a public weened on War of the Worlds, wowed by Star Wars and waiting for E.T. But as a game, Space Invaders‘ pixelated baddies moved closer and faster—with crazy-making sound effects to match—players’ pulses kept pace. Playing the classic version today is like watching a 1950s monster flick, partly comedic reflection, seeing what once gave us thrills.

Alas, like Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, Charles Dickens’ The Mystery of Edwin Drood or Mervyn Peake’s Gormenghast, we may never know how protagonist Gordon Freeman’s tale ends.

The massive revenue it generated for years also spurred legions of game designers to try to create similar online playgrounds.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Get it now</strong></a></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">9. <a href=# rel=noopener>The Oregon Trail</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-video-games-the-oregon-trail.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“You have died of dysentery.” The Oregon Trail’s notorious proclamation of ultimate doom was only part of the software’s brutal charm. As a simulation of Westward Expansion consisting of choose-your-own-adventure strategy and hunt-to-survive gameplay, it was rudimentary. But in part because it was originally developed in 1971 by three student teachers at Carleton College in Minnesota as an educational tool, The Oregon Trail found a captive—and willing—audience in thousands of classrooms across the country equipped with Apple II computers in the 1980s. There, it helped introduce an entire generation (several, in fact) to video games.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Get it now</a></strong></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">8. <a href=# rel=noopener>Super Mario Bros.</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-video-games-super-mario-bros.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s 1985, the Nintendo Entertainment System has invaded American living rooms, and brothers <a href=# rel=noopener>Mario and Luigi</a> are running rampant through the Mushroom Kingdom. They’re stomping on goombas, de-shelling winged turtles, bashing question mark blocks and lobbing fireballs—like this is totally normal plumber behavior. (Clearly the 1970s drugs worked.) Yet however bizarre this side-scroller seems at face value, it’s also as insanely fun to play today as it was three decades ago. And in the wake of Mario’s nonstop running, this platformer par excellence turned the NES into a must-have appliance, Mario into a beloved gaming franchise and Nintendo into a household name.

Mixing upgradable weapons with a (then) sprawling map and some pretty good puzzles, Link’s original adventure delivered an experience unlike anything console players had experienced. Shigeru Miyamoto, the game’s legendary designer, set out to create a world that felt like a “miniature garden that [players] can put inside their drawer.” And through the cartridge’s ability to save games (the first console title to offer the option) they could do exactly that. Instead of toiling to beat Zelda in a single sitting, players could instead pace themselves, scrutinizing every last nook and cranny of Hyrule at leisure—an obsession that’s continued through all 18 games (and counting) in this storied series.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Get it now</strong></a></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">6. <a href=# rel=noopener>Minecraft</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/minecraft-battle-mode.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Swedish studio Mojang’s indie bolt from the blue turns out to be that rare example of a game whose title perfectly sums up its gameplay: you mine stuff, then you craft it.

An unlicensed modification of 1980’s Pac-Man, this 1982 game was initially called “Crazy Otto”—until the developers sold it to Midway, which branded it Ms. Pac-Man to lure female gamers. But Ms. Pac-Man did much more than put a bow on an already wildly popular game. With four mazes (compared to Pac-Man’s one), smarter ghosts and on-the-move fruit bonuses, it quickly obsoleted the original. The fact that it’s still fun to play gives it a high perch on this list. Admit it—if you came across a Ms. Pac-Man cabinet in the wild, you’d drop a quarter in.

Another id title, Wolfenstein 3D, may have arrived a year earlier. But Doom became a true phenomenon, introducing millions of gamers to what have become bedrock principles of the genre, from frenzied multiplayer deathmatches to player-led mods that can alter or completely overhaul a game’s look and feel.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Get it now</strong></a></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">3. <a href=# rel=noopener>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-video-games-zelda-ocarina-of-time-3d.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Longtime pointy-eared and green-trousered protagonist Link’s 1998 Nintendo 64 odyssey through a vast, three-dimensionally exquisite version of Hyrule routinely tops “best” games lists for several reasons. Its approach to letting players explore a 3D world was so consummate and sublime, that it felt less like Nintendo shoehorning eureka concepts into a new paradigm, than the paradigm bending to Nintendo whims. Its clockwork puzzles, artful area and dungeon levels, and breakthrough interface—we can thank Nintendo for intuitive lock-on targeting that preserves our freedom to execute other actions—were so groundbreaking, they’re reverently hat-tipped by just about every designer, prompting some <a href=# rel=noopener>to call the game a “walking patent office.</a>”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Get it now</a></strong></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">2. <a href=# rel=noopener>Super Mario 64</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-video-games-super-mario-64.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Mario’s brick-breaking, Goomba-stomping antics were enough to mesmerize the world’s gamers in Nintendo’s idiosyncratic side-scrolling Super Mario Bros. games. But 1996’s Super Mario 64 transported Nintendo fans into Mario’s universe as no other game in the series had, simultaneously laying out a grammar for how to interact with 3D worlds (and in its case, divinely zany ones). At more than 11 million copies sold, it was one of the bestselling games for the Nintendo 64, but its real impact was arguably off-platform, where it tectonically shifted the design imperatives of an entire industry.

In 1989, Nintendo put the legendary tile-matching puzzler on the NES and Game Boy, where it catapulted the latter to meteoric success. It’s been available on nearly every platform since, a testament to our never-ending zeal for stacking blocks. However addictive, Tetris also appears to have modest health benefits, like <a href=#>cravings control</a> and <a href=#>PTSD prevention</a>. Devotees would probably nod and note how much a high-scoring, in-the-zone session can feel like meditation. And speaking of Zen, the game’s also generated its share of life lessons, including <a href=# rel=noopener>this apocryphal truism</a>: “If Tetris has taught me anything, it’s that errors pile up and accomplishments disappear.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Get it now</strong></a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>(<i>Read TIME’s affiliate link policy</i>.)</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtbGVtgnaAjpucrKxdq7alsc5mnpqllah6orjLZquipZVk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
