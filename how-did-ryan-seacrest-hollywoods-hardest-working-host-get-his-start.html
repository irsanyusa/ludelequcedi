Although <a href=#>Ryan Seacrest</a> is well known as one of the biggest hosts in Hollywood, how did he get his honorable title?</strong></p><p><a href=#>Started from the bottom</a> now we here is seriously a phrase that Seacrest could use to explain his life. He grew up just outside of Atlanta, GA, and was a huge fan of the radio since he was born. His childhood dream was to become a radio DJ, and I think we all know how that went for him.</p><p>Seacrest began his lengthy career when he read his high school’s morning announcements, but is still nowhere near finishing it yet. While in high school, Seacrest landed an internship at one of the top radio stations in Atlanta. He ended up staying with the radio station when he went to the University of Georgia.</p><p>loading="lazy"</p><p>Seacrest began hosting in the 1990s with the shows Radical Outdoor Challenge on ESPN and The Syndicated Kids Show. During this time he also began another radio gig, Ryan Seacrest for the Ride Home which became the most listened to segment. That eventually led to his beginning of the Top 40 with Ryan Seacrest that we know and love.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-his-big-break-american-idol>His Big Break: American Idol</h2><p>In 2002, Seacrest began his hosting job that we all know, and love, American Idol. This is truly when his career took off. The singing show began with two hosts, but after season one Seacrest was the only one that remained. He became the most iconic part of the series! It is really his charming personality and radio-perfect speaking voice that makes people drool over him to this day.</p><p>It’s reported that Seacrest signed a $45 million deal to keep hosting the show, but now only gets paid $10 million per season in the reboot. At one point, he was considered the the top-earning presenter because of his $45 million deal.</p><p>On top of being the face of live television, Seacrest wanted to get into the production side of the show. He took notes from his mentor, Dick Clark, before making the jump. Seacrest was so close to Clark that he began hosting the annual Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin Eve in 2012. While Seacrest was already doing amazing things, he joined E News and even became a lead anchor for them. He signed a $20 million contract that permitted him to host and produce the series on the network.</p><figure class=wp-block-embed readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CSeY_CglU6y/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ryan-seacrest-makes-how-much>Ryan Seacrest Makes How Much?!</h2><p>It’s no secret that Seacrest is one of the richest celebrities in Hollywood. He brought in so much revenue from hosting, producing, radio gigs, advertisements, and even more. At this point, what hasn’t he done? He’s launched a clothing line with Macy’s, created his own skincare brand, and has hosted on Live With Kelly and Ryan since 2017.</p><p>On top of how busy he is with work, Seacrest still manages to have a personal life. Although him and Shayna Taylor split in 2020, he’s gotten back into the dating scene. He has once again found love and is currently dating 23-year-old model Aubrey Paige.</p><p>To this day, Seacrest is by far one of the highest paid celebrities in Hollywood. It’s reported that he has a net worth of $450 million. It’s insane anyone could even make that much money.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/161207_0575-e1638202169728.jpeg alt="Eliminated ‘DWTS’ Couple Olivia Jade, Val Chmerkovskiy Record Freestyle Routine" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>ryan seacrest</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57x6iuZpyZmXqzxcCnZKydkZi%2Fpr%2FTZp%2BopJyuxLC7w6xkoZmimbK0wIywpqujmaO0brTOrKtmn5Wpeqm10maqrZmiqXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
