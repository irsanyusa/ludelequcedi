I couldn't stand to see her suffering, so I took a second job and accepted some online work, as well. I worked day and night and couldn't get any proper sleep the whole year. Finally, I saved up enough money for corrective eye surgery. My wife recently returned from the hospital and she was amazed at how clearly she could see everything. The past year was tough on me, but I do not regret it one bit, because now I have a healthy son and a happy wife. <strong>They are the most important people in my life.</strong><strong></strong></p></li><li readability=9><p>My mother was struggling with a heart problem and I lived with her for one week while my father was away on a business trip. He was due back yesterday and while we were sitting in the kitchen waiting for him, I noticed how beautiful she looked, despite being so thin and pale. There was a serene expression on her face, but her hands were shaking. Suddenly, we heard the lock turn and my mother jumped up and ran to my father, embraced him tearfully, and mumbled something into his shoulder. He hugged her in return and I just stood there, watching them and smiling. <strong>My father's love is my mother's greatest remedy.</strong><strong></strong></p></li><li readability=6><p>I met a funny, kind, and educated young man on the internet. He was also very handsome. We used Skype to stay in touch for several years. <strong>After a while, I understood that I loved him and he said he loved me, but he was afraid to meet.</strong> I insisted on meeting and traveled thousands of miles to see him. It turned out that the young man was disabled and he couldn't walk. We spent 3 months together and we quickly got engaged. <strong>He is the best and he is perfect for me - my Professor X!</strong></p></li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZIZuv8eoqa1lo6m8s7XErGSamp%2BqwW7A0a6cZqSfq7JugJFyZ29oXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
