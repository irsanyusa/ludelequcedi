Now, new YouGov Omnibus research explores British attitudes to the prospects of having robots as friends, partners, colleagues, and attendants.</p><h4><strong>One in five young Brits can imagine being friends with a robot</strong></h4><p>One in eight (13%) Brits can imagine themselves being friends with a robot in the future. This figure is highest among young people, with just over a fifth (23%) of 25 to 34 year olds and one in five (20%) 18 to 24 year olds saying they could ‘probably’ or ‘definitely’ see it happening. Older people are much less likely to see a robot friendship in the horizon, with just one in fifteen (7%) saying they 'definitely' or 'probably' could imagine it.</p><p>By the same token, older people are more likely to think they would never be friends with a robot (53% of those aged 55+, compared to 29% among the under-25s).</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/RobotFriends1.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h4><strong>Men more likely than women to be able to imagine a robot romance</strong></h4><p>One in twenty Brits (5%) can imagine having a romantic relationship with a robot one day. Again, those aged 25-34 are most likely to see this as a possibility, with one in eleven (9%) saying they can either 'probably' or 'definitely' imagine it.</p><p>Men are more likely than women to say they could imagine having a romantic relationship with a robot (7% vs 2%). Women are considerably more likely to rule out getting amorous with an android (83% vs 66% of men).</p><p>However, most of us say a robot romance isn't on the cards. Three quarters (75%) of Brits state that they 'definitely would not’ imagine ever entering into a romantic relationship with a robot at any point in the future.</p><h4><strong>Majority of Brits don’t like the sound of a robot colleague, let alone a robot manager</strong></h4><p>Most Brits would not feel at ease about the prospect of working with a robot colleague at the same level as them, with six in ten (59%) being either 'fairly' or 'very' uncomfortable with the thought. Just a quarter (27%) would be comfortable at the prospect – although support increases among younger people, rising to a third of those aged 18 to 24 (32%) and 25 to 34 (34%).</p><p>Brits are even less enthusiastic about having a robot line manager. Just one in six (16%) say they would be comfortable being managed by a robot, with men being slightly more likely than women to be comfortable (20% vs 12%).</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Victoria_robots-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><strong>A third of Brits would be ruder to a robot providing poor service than a human</strong><br>YouGov also asked how Brits’ interactions with robots would differ to their dealings with humans in a service situation, were the robot able to respond to the tone and emotion in a person’s voice.</p><p>Specifically, respondents were asked whether or not they would be ruder to a robot assistant or waiter that was providing poor service than they would to a human doing the same. One in three (31%) say they are more likely to be rude, with just 7% saying they are less likely to be rude. Half (48%) say it would make no difference.</p><p>Photo: Getty</p><p><a href=#>See full results here</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwaavx6empaeXrnyivtOimqWdo2R%2FcoCXcWSoppVis6rCxGawqK2enHqjvsitqmabkaN6qrnAoKCnnV2Xsqq6xmadq6GVo7G0edGomQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
