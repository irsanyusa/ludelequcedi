While their stage name Bella was inspired by their Italian grandfather, their switch back to Garcia is about honoring their Mexican roots.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nikki-and-brie-garcia-talk-about-changing-their-names>Nikki and Brie Garcia Talk About Changing Their Names</h2><p>In March, the sisters shared that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">they would now be known</a> as Nikki Garcia and Brie Garcia, or the Garcia Twins. They even rebranded their podcast, which was previously called The Bellas Podcast, as The Nikki & Brie Show.</p><p>“It’s such a metaphor for us, because for so long when we were the Bellas,” Nikki told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PopSugar</a> in a recent interview. “Brie and I came up with that name and it was because of our full-blooded Italian grandfather, who is a massive part of our life and our upbringing. That was a showcase of our Italian roots, and stepping into Garcia, it’s like we finally get to represent our Mexican side.”</p><p>The sisters considered taking their husbands’ last names, but Brie said they ultimately decided “to go back to who we were before.” Nikki shared that she and Brie practiced meditation while they thought about what name to use.</p><p>“I just started to think of my ancestors and what the women went through centuries ago,” she said. “I was like, ‘You know what? Being a Garcia is representing my Mexican side, my ancestors who had no voice.’ And it just got really deep for me. I was like, ‘I am a Garcia and I’m so damn proud of it.'”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NIKKI AND BRIE GARCIA SHARE WHY THEY DROPPED ‘BELLA’ FROM THEIR NAMES</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-sisters-are-hosting-tv-shows-this-year>The Sisters Are Hosting TV Shows This Year</h3><p>This summer, Nikki and Brie will be co-hosting the Prime Video dating competition Twin Love, which focuses on 10 sets of identical twins looking for love. Meanwhile, Nikki is returning to host the second season of Blake Shelton and Carson Daly’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">game show Barmageddon</a>.</p><p>“Individually and together, we both really want to grow in TV,” Nikki told PopSugar. “We want to grow in non-scripted and continue to make magic happen, whether that’s on a hosting stage or in front of the camera doing what Brie and I do best, but also scripted.”</p><p>Brie said she also wants to focus more on philanthropy and do “more activist work with Greenpeace.” She added, “I’ve always had a dream of ending my life with United Nations and finding more world peace.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Original_JoJoSiwa_PrideLine-220x147.png alt="JoJo Siwa Launches Inclusive Pride Merchandise, Available May 1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Brie Garcia</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>nikki garcia</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zaKipKFdlrulecGroJ5ll5a%2FpLXArGSnmZ2aeqS0wKeenmWYpLuwvtJmq6Gdmad6rrHXopqapl2nvLDA0mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
