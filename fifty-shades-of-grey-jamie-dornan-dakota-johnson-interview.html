In movie parlance, it’s called the meet-cute. “It’s the first time that we see Christian, and we see him in his highly impressive office, very much in charge and in a position of power,” says Dornan. “And all of that has to come across, but we also have to quickly feel the connection between the two right away.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Dornan notes that the cast had two days to shoot the scene, “which means that I wasn’t the only one thinking that we really needed to get it right.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Johnson, perhaps not surprisingly, found one of her scenes in Grey’s bondage lair the most taxing. “There’s a scene in which Christian uses a flogger on Anastasia,” she says. “Filming a sex scene is not a sensual or pleasurable environment. It’s really hot — not in a steamy, sexual way. It’s just sweaty and it’s not very comfortable. And on top of that, my hands and legs were tied, and I was blindfolded, and I was being hit with this bizarre tool.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Not only did Johnson have all her senses taken away, but she had to do the scene several times, for several hours. How did she handle it? Not as badly as many of us might have. “It was emotionally taxing,” she says. “At first I was like, ‘Oh my God, this is the worst thing ever,’ and then I was like, ‘All right, let’s get on with it.'”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Read next: <a href=# rel=noopener>Fifty Shades of Grey Director Cut the Book’s Most Talked-About Scene</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>Listen to the most important stories of the day.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZsbmllhXJ9jp%2Bgn6ypYsCprcOeqmanlmK0s7HYZqGapZmaeqW70aeYp2WUlriwwMBmoaignqi8r3nIp6ueqqaesrh7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
