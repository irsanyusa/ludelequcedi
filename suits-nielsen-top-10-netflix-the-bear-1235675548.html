“Suits” was watched for 2.3 billion minutes during this viewing period, which marked the first full week that the series has been available on Netflix — though it should be noted that “Suits” was already available on Peacock, and this statistic indicates viewership across both streamers."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

During the June 19-25 viewing window, a new-old favorite took the No. 1 position: “<a href=# id=auto-tag_suits data-tag=suits>Suits</a>,” the USA Network legal drama that concluded in 2019 and recently landed on Netflix.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Suits” was watched for 2.3 billion minutes during this viewing period, which marked the first full week that the series has been available on Netflix — though it should be noted that “Suits” was already available on Peacock, and this statistic indicates viewership across both streamers. This is the first time in nearly four months that a title has crossed the 2 billion minute mark on the Nielsen Streaming Top 10, with the most recent winner of that achievement being “The Night Agent” with 3.1 billion minutes watched from March 27 to April 2. And that happens even less with titles acquired from other networks, rather than streaming originals — “Manifest” was the last with 2.5 billion minutes watched from June 21-27 of 2021.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Also notable from this week’s streaming rankings was the No. 5 showing of “<a href=# id=auto-tag_the-bear data-tag=the-bear>The Bear</a>” after its second season debuted on Hulu. As a series with half-hour episodes (minus a few exceptions), it’s more difficult to compete against dramas with longer running times, but the popular dramedy was watched for 853 million minutes during this viewing window.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The No. 2 position went to “Black Mirror,” kicked down by “Suits” after debuting on top the previous week, when its sixth season debuted. The series garnered a still impressive 1.5 billion minutes watched in Season 6’s first full week of availability, up from 1.3 billion minutes the week before.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“S.W.A.T.” had its sixth week in a row on the <a href=# id=auto-tag_nielsen-top-10 data-tag=nielsen-top-10>Nielsen Top 10</a>, first appearing after CBS canceled the drama then reversed the decision and renewed it for a seventh and final season. “S.W.A.T.” was watched for just over one billion minutes from June 19-25. In fourth place was “Extraction 2,” the sequel to the 2020 Chris Hemsworth-led film “Extraction,” also with just over one billion minutes watched.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Grey’s Anatomy” took sixth place with 772 million minutes watched following the addition of Season 19 to Netflix. Seventh and eighth place went to Nielsen Top 10 regulars “Bluey” (770 million) and “NCIS” (710 million).</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Avatar: The Way of Water” had its third week in a row on the chart following its streaming debut on Disney+ and Max after debuting theatrically in November. From June 19-25, the movie was watched for 671 million minutes.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">At the bottom of the overall chart was “Manifest.” In the third week of full availability for the series fourth and final season, it was watched for 658 million minutes.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">See Nielsen’s list of overall streaming rankings for June 19-25 first, followed by original streaming titles, acquired titles and then films.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-8.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-3.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-9.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-10.png><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiukae2psDYZ5qopV9nfXN%2Fjq2taKaVrMBwv9Siq6xlnp6yrb%2FEp2Stp6BifnF5zZ6rn6SZrXq1tMRmmZ6ZomJ%2Bc3%2BUb25ubWRtfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
