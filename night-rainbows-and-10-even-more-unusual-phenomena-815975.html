Well, it is — because it’s a lunar rainbow, also known as a moonbow. Moonbows are as cool as they are rare. They occur when the light gets refracted through water droplets in the air, just like it happens when a normal rainbow forms. But the source of light, in this case, is different. I’m sure you’ve already guessed that it’s the Moon."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It’s been raining, and now, the air is&nbsp;fresh and damp. And that’s when you see it&nbsp;— a&nbsp;<a href=# title=rainbow data-link=tag>rainbow</a>! But it’s nighttime! Is&nbsp;it&nbsp;even real?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/5ab/ed4/ac170c5d1c9c803867e1d4d3fb.jpeg><p>Well, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;— because it’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>a&nbsp;lunar rainbow</a>, also known as&nbsp;a&nbsp;moonbow. Moonbows are as&nbsp;cool as&nbsp;they are rare. They occur when the light gets refracted through water droplets in&nbsp;the air, just like it&nbsp;happens when a&nbsp;normal rainbow forms. But the source of&nbsp;light, in&nbsp;this case, is&nbsp;different. I’m sure you’ve already guessed that it’s the <a href=# title=Moon data-link=tag>Moon</a>. Or&nbsp;rather, sunlight reflected off the Moon. Since moonbows are produced at&nbsp;night, when there’s much less light, they’re a&nbsp;lot more difficult to&nbsp;spot. Often, a&nbsp;moonbow looks like a&nbsp;pale white ring. That’s because the light is&nbsp;normally so&nbsp;faint that the cone color receptors in&nbsp;human eyes can’t detect the hues. Also, experts claim that how bright the colors are depends on&nbsp;the size of&nbsp;water droplets in&nbsp;the air. The smaller they are, the less vivid the colors. If&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;witness a&nbsp;moonbow, opt for a&nbsp;night when the Moon is&nbsp;at&nbsp;its fullest, for example, during a&nbsp;full Moon phase. The Moon also has to&nbsp;be&nbsp;low in&nbsp;the sky and not obscured by&nbsp;clouds. In&nbsp;the&nbsp;US, you can see moonbows next to&nbsp;waterfalls, including Niagara Falls, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;Yosemite National Park and other places.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/916/334/edcbcf5b038a096f098f89321d.jpeg><p>But you can see mesmerizing natural phenomena not only at&nbsp;night after the rain. For example, look at&nbsp;these <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>brinicles!</a> They are hollow icicles, also known as&nbsp;underwater stalactites. They form when cold salt water freezes in&nbsp;the right conditions. Then brinicles can reach the ocean floor and start pulling there. They can even freeze some slow-moving underwater inhabitants, like starfish!</p><p>This next phenomenon is&nbsp;even more dangerous than brinicles! Sinkholes occur when water that has turned acidic after coming into contact with <a href=# title=plants data-link=tag>plants</a> or&nbsp;carbon dioxide erodes soft kinds of&nbsp;rock, like gypsum or&nbsp;limestone. This forms a&nbsp;deep underground cavern that can one day open anywhere&nbsp;— even under your house. One such sinkhole opened up&nbsp;in&nbsp;New York City. It&nbsp;pulled a&nbsp;parked van into the earth. It&nbsp;happened in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>the summer of&nbsp;2022</a>. And it&nbsp;wasn’t the only sinkhole to&nbsp;appear in&nbsp;that area. Local inhabitants reported around <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>4,000 sinkholes</a> all over the city. This kind of&nbsp;problem is&nbsp;also very common in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Florida data-link=tag>Florida</a>. And it’s much more serious than it&nbsp;may sound. Sinkholes open all of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sudden, pulling down everything and everyone that happens to&nbsp;be&nbsp;nearby. Sinkholes appear all over the world, which makes them a&nbsp;global problem. They’re totally unpredictable and form without warning. Another reason for their formation might be&nbsp;vast areas of&nbsp;groundwater. During droughts, this water dries&nbsp;up. This creates large empty caverns. After heavy rains, the surface over such a&nbsp;cavern can collapse, creating a&nbsp;sinkhole within minutes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/f9c/fde/e751dc532fbacb57ab41c4faf9.jpeg><p>This phenomenon is&nbsp;much more beautiful and way less dangerous than sinkholes. Just look at&nbsp;this beach! Is&nbsp;it... glowing?! Your eyes aren’t deceiving you&nbsp;— you can see this phenomenon all over the world. It’s caused by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>phytoplankton in&nbsp;the water.</a> It&nbsp;gives off light when the movements of&nbsp;waves and currents disturb&nbsp;it. This particular species of&nbsp;phytoplankton glows blue, turning the ocean into a&nbsp;gigantic lava lamp. At&nbsp;the same time, if&nbsp;you saw it&nbsp;during the day, you’d probably feel disgusted because the thick visible layer of&nbsp;the plankton near the surface of&nbsp;the water doesn’t look... well ... nice.</p><p>Waterspouts are also known as&nbsp;sea tornados. They occur over warm ocean waters. Waterspouts look like funnel-shaped clouds reaching down from the stormy skies. Most of&nbsp;them don’t pull in&nbsp;water&nbsp;— they’re rather weak rotating columns of&nbsp;air hovering above the surface of&nbsp;the water. Some waterspouts begin as&nbsp;dry land tornados. Then they travel toward a&nbsp;body of&nbsp;water and turn into severe thunderstorms with hail, high winds, and lightning.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/80c/f98/61f33154679a1d4c17d07ccf2d.jpeg><p>During the summer, in&nbsp;forests all over the world, you might see a&nbsp;faint eerie glow called “foxfire.” It&nbsp;might look mystical and a&nbsp;bit scary, but the nature of&nbsp;this glow is&nbsp;very simple. It’s produced by&nbsp;bioluminescent mushrooms growing on&nbsp;moist rotting bark. You can find lots of&nbsp;these mushrooms in&nbsp;the tropics, where damp forests encourage their growth. To&nbsp;increase your chances of&nbsp;seeing some of&nbsp;those magical fungi, hunt them in&nbsp;the forest during the wettest season. Plus, move as&nbsp;far away from artificial light sources as&nbsp;possible. Otherwise, you won’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;spot this faint glow. And if&nbsp;you find one&nbsp;— nope! Don’t do&nbsp;that! They’re not THAT kind of&nbsp;mushroom!</p><p>Fire rainbows are another phenomenon that occurs in&nbsp;the summer. They appear when sunlight interacts with frozen ice crystals in&nbsp;high-altitude clouds. Interestingly, for a&nbsp;fire rainbow to&nbsp;appear, you don’t need any rain. That’s why scientists prefer to&nbsp;refer to&nbsp;this beautiful natural phenomenon by&nbsp;its official name: the circumhorizontal arc. This arc occurs when the sun is&nbsp;very high in&nbsp;the sky, and there’s one special variety of&nbsp;clouds. That’s why you’re more likely to&nbsp;see fire rainbows closer to&nbsp;the equator. In&nbsp;other words, if&nbsp;you’re in&nbsp;Los Angeles, you can spot them for six months out of&nbsp;the year, while in&nbsp;more northern cities, like London, this window is&nbsp;merely 2&nbsp;months.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/611/1b7/13565c5deca40d8970cfff5363.jpeg><p>Look at&nbsp;this cute roll&nbsp;— it&nbsp;looks handmade. But it’s actually a&nbsp;natural phenomenon called the snow roller. Snow rollers are formed when there’s a&nbsp;thick layer of&nbsp;fresh snow that covers a&nbsp;layer of&nbsp;ice. When the temperature and wind speed are just right, some snow breaks loose and starts rolling. While rolling, it&nbsp;picks up&nbsp;additional snow and ends up&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;large snow donut. The conditions creating these “pastries” must be&nbsp;very precise&nbsp;— that’s why they’re quite rare.</p><p>Have you ever climbed the stairs of&nbsp;the Giant’s Causeway in&nbsp;Ireland? They sure look as&nbsp;if&nbsp;they were created by&nbsp;people. But in&nbsp;fact, this absolutely awesome formation is&nbsp;natural and has a&nbsp;scientific name&nbsp;— columnar basalt. These mostly hexagonal columns have a&nbsp;volcanic origin&nbsp;— they appear when lava cools very fast, contracting and creating various cracks in&nbsp;the surface of&nbsp;the new rock.</p><p>Now, look at&nbsp;the sky&nbsp;— fast! This phenomenon is&nbsp;extremely rare, so&nbsp;you’d be&nbsp;very lucky to&nbsp;witness&nbsp;it. These clouds are called asperatus, and they managed to&nbsp;avoid being classified until 2009. They seem to&nbsp;be&nbsp;ominous and stormy. But in&nbsp;most cases, they break up&nbsp;very quickly without producing a&nbsp;storm&nbsp;— blink, and you’ll miss them. These clouds get formed when colliding air masses or&nbsp;turbulent winds whip up&nbsp;the bottoms of&nbsp;cloud layers, creating amazing shapes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/fe4/387/f04edc571b8629129c2c1bde92.jpeg><p>Now, put on&nbsp;your winter jacket&nbsp;— we’re heading to&nbsp;the north to&nbsp;look at&nbsp;very unusual icebergs. The thing&nbsp;is, not all of&nbsp;these formations are monochrome. Some of&nbsp;them have different colored stripes, which stand out starkly against the whites and blues of&nbsp;the Arctic. The process of&nbsp;the formation of&nbsp;these stripes is&nbsp;quite simple&nbsp;— see for yourself. Water melts and freezes on&nbsp;an&nbsp;iceberg, with dirt and particles of&nbsp;different minerals getting trapped on&nbsp;its surface. They create multicolored stripes with a&nbsp;variety of&nbsp;colors. As&nbsp;for these blue stripes, they appear when water gets trapped between two layers of&nbsp;ice and freezes so&nbsp;fast that air bubbles don’t have enough time to&nbsp;form. And if&nbsp;an&nbsp;iceberg breaks off and falls into the ocean, algae present in&nbsp;the water might create yellow or&nbsp;green stripes.</p><p>If&nbsp;a&nbsp;storm holds back your long-awaited picnic, keep calm and think about how lucky you are that it’s not the Catatumbo&nbsp;— the world’s longest lightning storm! The heart of&nbsp;the storm, which repeats every year, is&nbsp;over Lake Maracaibo in&nbsp;Venezuela. It&nbsp;towers way higher than your regular thunderstorm. This natural phenomenon <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>occurs for a&nbsp;whopping 140 to&nbsp;160 </a>nights a&nbsp;year, lasts for 9&nbsp;hours a&nbsp;day, and produces 16&nbsp;to&nbsp;40&nbsp;lightning flashes per minute. You’ve probably heard how they say that lightning doesn’t strike twice in&nbsp;the same place. Well, the Catatumbo seems to&nbsp;not know about this rule. Or, at&nbsp;least, it&nbsp;doesn’t prevent storm clouds from gathering in&nbsp;the very same place, year after year.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLuqs8etZKuZmaOvsMPSZpinnF1mfW6x1Z6lZqWfp7Juwc2uqq6ZnGK9qbHNqKSeppFihXKBmHBsaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
