The main purpose of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the search</a> is to find the best singer in each city and declare them the winner.</p><p>The tour was initially advertised as the search for the next talented singer to be featured on the show. It is revealed that the tour was actually about Clarkson promoting season four, by bringing it with the local affiliates. Despite the revelation, Clarkson still manages to find great singers, one of which also competed in The Voice.</p><p>Fans of The Voice probably recognized the name <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sandy Redd</a>, since she was a Team Kelly member back in season 15. She originally picked Clarkson as her coach after a four-chair turn and made it to the top 13. Clarkson admitted that her previous coaching of Redd contributed to her becoming a Kellyoke winner. Redd won the Kellyoke search for the city of Chicago.</p><p>The New York City winner, Kyana Fanene once competed on the NBC a-cappella competition show,&nbsp;The Sing-Off. She also had a small role in the Academy Award-winning film CODA as a choir member.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p><a href=#>Jon Battagliese</a> is the Los Angeles winner&nbsp;who made daily TikTok videos over the course of ten weeks. The videos consisted of wishing Clarkson a good day, and have caught the attention of Clarkson’s people. The Dallas winner Jade Massentoff made a name for herself in the Dallas/Fort Worth area.</p><p>The TikTok winner,&nbsp;Pershard Owens surprisingly only has about 250 followers on the platform. Owens is the winner with the least amount of experience but has released a few singles of his own.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Winners Expressed Their Gratitude on Instagram</h2><p>The excitement can truly be felt from the Kellyoke winners as they took to Instagram to post about their win. Fanene posted to her Instagram writing, “IM STILL DREAMING,” showing her full support to Clarkson afterward.</p><p>The other winners such as The Voice alum also posted with similar captions showing how excited she is. Interestingly enough, all posts from the winners invite the viewers to tune in to The Kelly Clarkson Show. It is likely that these winners will return to the show in the near future.</p><p>All of the winners will take this opportunity to expand on their career to become well established artists of their own. We cannot wait to see what The Kelly Clarkson Show Kellyoke winners will do next.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-08-at-11.04.55-AM-1.png alt="Jennifer Hudson, Leslie Jordan Talk ‘The Masked Singer’ Rumors" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yp6jpbFdmLmivsqspqerXaCyrbjYqKKeZaeeu6%2Bx0axkq52mmq6tscNmpqdlpJ2ybr%2FHqK5moZ6YubawyKeeZqyYmnq3u8icnGarpJa%2Fbr%2FAp5uyZaKasaV7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
