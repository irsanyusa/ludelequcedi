They included British tech magnate Mike Lynch and his daughter.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Termini Imerese prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio confirmed the investigation has been launched, but said no suspect is currently identified.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“We are only in the initial phase of the investigation. We can’t exclude any sort of development at present,” he told reporters at a news conference.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Cartosio said his team will carefully consider each possible element of responsibility, including those of the ship's captain, the crew, individuals in charge of supervision, the ship-builder and others.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“For me, it is probable that offences were committed, that it could be a case of manslaughter, but we can only establish that if you give us the time to investigate," he said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The main question investigators are focusing on is how a sailing vessel deemed “unsinkable” by its manufacturer, Italian shipyard Perini Navi, sank while a nearby sailboat remained largely unscathed.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Prosecutors said the event was “extremely rapid” and information they gained seemed pointing to a “downburst,” a localised, powerful wind that descends from a thunderstorm and spreads out rapidly upon hitting the ground.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Initially, Civil protection officials said they believe the yacht, which featured a distinctive 75-meter (246-feet) aluminum mast, was struck by a tornado over the water, known as a waterspout.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Investigators were also asked why the crew was almost entirely saved, except for the chef, while six passengers remained trapped in the hull.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Local official confirmed that most of the bodies recovered were found in the same part of the ship — on the left side and closer to the surface — suggesting that passengers had sought safety in the cabins where the last air bubbles had formed.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Deputy Prosecutor Raffaele Cammarano said it was likely that the passengers were asleep, adding that one of the main focus of the investigation is to ascertain whether they were alerted by someone.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Cammarano confirmed that one person was on watch in the cockpit.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Rescuers on Friday brought ashore the last of seven bodies from the sinking of The Bayesian, a 56-meter (184-foot) British-flagged luxury yacht that went down in a storm near the Mediterranean island in southern Italy early Monday. The sailboat was carrying a crew of 10 people and 12 passengers.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The seventh victim was Hannah Lynch, 18, the daughter of Mike Lynch, whose body was recovered Thursday. He had been celebrating his recent acquittal on fraud charges with his family and the people who had defended him at trial in the United States. His wife, Angela Bacares, was among the 15 survivors.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Rescuers struggled for four days to find all the bodies, making only slow headway through the interior of the wreck lying on the seabed 50 meters (164 feet) below the surface.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The other five victims are Christopher Morvillo, one of Lynch’s U.S. lawyers, and his wife, Neda; Jonathan Bloomer, chairman of Morgan Stanley’s London-based investment banking subsidiary, and his wife, Judy; and Recaldo Thomas, the yacht’s chef.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZwaGFpgniAjqKrmqSZlrtuvNGoqp6bpam8s7%2BMrJ%2BiqKensqS3jKaYp6uclsKotNOeqWahnquytMDIoJitoZ%2Bjeq61yp5kpbGemLVuv9SpnKtlqZawqcCMrKCno5mjtHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
