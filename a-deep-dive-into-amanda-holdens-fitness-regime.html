The radio presenter and TV host ensures she looks her best in every screen appearance, but it doesn’t take one day to do that. Here’s everything to know about Holden’s fitness plan to keep her body in shape and healthy.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-amanda-holden-engages-in-various-workout-routines>Amanda Holden Engages in Various Workout Routines</h2><p>In her recent interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Cosmopolitan</a>, Holden went into details regarding her physical health maintenance. According to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Britain’s Got Talent</a> judge, she involves herself in multiple workouts. Holden normally runs four miles three times a week.</p><p>“I have to run for my rosé wine in the summer and run for my red wine in winter,” she said. “And I don’t do it because I feel I have to; I do it for my own discipline and dignity.”</p><p>Holden said running is the “one time I can be alone with my thoughts and clear my head.” Previously, she said she typically aims for a 36-minute run.</p><p>In her fitness style, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Holden</a> employs the viking method to serve as her functional training. Meanwhile, for her mental health, she does Kundalini yoga. As per the television host, she began doing the exercise after struggling from a disquieting experience when she gave birth to her daughter Hollie.</p><p>“A lot of people advised me to do it for calmness, too. I don’t really sit still, I’m always on the go,” she said. “There’s one exercise called the Breath of Fire which is great for abs. But it’s also a good pick-me-up when you’re tired – honestly, it’s better than a cup of coffee!”</p><p>Lastly, Holden goes hiking from time to time. As a matter of fact, she’s already completed three peaks challenges in Snowdon in 2022.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-makes-sure-her-diet-plan-is-unrestrictive>She Makes Sure Her Diet Plan is Unrestrictive</h2><p>Regarding her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">diet</a>, Holden stated she’s not too exacting and stern about what she eats. According to the tv personality, she doesn’t want to be miserable by employing a very restrictive diet. Thus, she makes sure that she gets to enjoy food and wine when she wants to.</p><p>“You have to enjoy life. I eat everything, drink everything,” she said. “I had a friend once who didn’t make it to her fifties and her biggest regret was she spent her life on a diet, I don’t diet.”</p><p>Be that as it may, Holden happily subscribes to a vegetarian diet. Hence, her meals usually consists of “lots of avocado, chickpeas and quinoa salads.”</p><p>Furthermore, Holden trusts collagen supplements to boost the elasticity of her skin. At present, the Kiss Me Kate alum is an ambassador for skincare brand Revive.</p><p>“I wouldn’t promote it if I didn’t believe in it — but you start to lose collagen in your twenties and replacing it has helped with the thickness of my hair and strengthening my nails, which were a bit lacklustre. Plus, my skin is better,” she said.</p><p>Ultimately, if there’s one important diet plan that Holden ascertains to do everyday, it is to drink plenty of water. Holden emphasized the importance of hydration. While she believes that her glowing skin is genetic, she heavily encourages people to drink loads of water, as well as coconut water.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Original_BobSaget_Mike-CoppolaGetty-Images-for-Tribeca-Festival.jpg alt="Bob Saget’s Wife, ‘Full House’ Co-Stars Pay Tribute to Him on His 2nd Death Anniversary" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>amanda holden</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Britain's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wGabnp2gYrGqwsRmoKesn2Kurq3NnZhmoJ%2Bhsaa60madoqyemsC0edGenqKllWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
