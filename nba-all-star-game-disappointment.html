To many fans, it was disappointingly uncompetitive with the lack of defense making it so boring it bordered on unwatchable.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>That was dreadful. Again. I am beginning to think this game is irredeemable. I am not sure why even minimal defense effort is beyond this generation of All-Stars. But it may be time to end this game if they can't give more of a damn than that.</p>— David Aldridge (@davidaldridgedc) <a href=#>February 19, 2024</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Many of the All-Star players say that they are worried about injuries, and are hesitant to push themselves for a game that has no bearing on the results of the rest of the season.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Obviously the fans and the league and everybody wants to be competitive, but then you also as players think about trying not to get hurt,” All-Star player Anthony Davis <a href=#>said</a>. “Obviously injuries are a part of the game, and no one wants to get hurt in the All-Star Game.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>My favorite All-Star tradition is watching Luka and Jokic lock horns in a battle to see who cares less about the game</p>— Michael Pina (@MichaelVPina) <a href=#>February 19, 2024</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This year, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and other league executives were pushing players to make the game more competitive after last year’s All-Star game television rating reached an all time low.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“And to the Eastern Conference All-Stars, you scored the most points,” said a visibly annoyed NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. “Well ... congratulations.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ahead of the All-Star Game, Silver was more upbeat, “I think we're going to see a good game” in the NBA’s annual midseason showcase at Gainbridge Fieldhouse on Sunday.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After the failure of this year’s game, fans have started coming up with creative incentives to push players to care more about the game’s outcome.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Team USA vs World is probably the only way to fix the All-Star game.
