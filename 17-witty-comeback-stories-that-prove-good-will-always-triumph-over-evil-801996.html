She’s always making snide comments about how&nbsp;I should’ve been a&nbsp;nurse or&nbsp;a&nbsp;lawyer. When I&nbsp;do make something, she always criticizes&nbsp;it. I’ve cooked 3-course dinners for the family and they always get positive reviews, except for from her. She had a&nbsp;party for her work friends, I&nbsp;made a&nbsp;whole tray of&nbsp;my&nbsp;specialty take on&nbsp;homemade meatballs. Everyone kept going back and getting more, so&nbsp;much so&nbsp;that they ran out.</p><p>I&nbsp;figured if&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;get her to&nbsp;compliment my&nbsp;cooking, I’d have to&nbsp;trick her. I&nbsp;cooked her a&nbsp;meal, one of&nbsp;her favorites from scratch, dressed it&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;look professional, and put it&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;generic to-go box. As&nbsp;I&nbsp;cooked, I&nbsp;had my&nbsp;boyfriend take a&nbsp;video of&nbsp;me&nbsp;preparing&nbsp;it, start to&nbsp;finish. I&nbsp;called her and told her that we&nbsp;were eating at&nbsp;this diner (that doesn’t exist), that they had her favorite meal, and asked if&nbsp;she wanted&nbsp;us to&nbsp;bring her one. Of&nbsp;course, she said yes. I&nbsp;brought the dish and she started eating it&nbsp;and complimented how good it&nbsp;was. After she was almost through with the meal, I&nbsp;asked her for her honest opinion, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;could write a&nbsp;review on&nbsp;Yelp. She went on&nbsp;for 10&nbsp;minutes about how great it&nbsp;was and then&nbsp;I sprung on&nbsp;her that&nbsp;I had cooked&nbsp;it.</p><p>Her tone changed. She put the fork down and said she was lying. My&nbsp;boyfriend showed her the video, she googled the restaurant, and it&nbsp;didn’t show&nbsp;up. She started pointing out flaws with the meal, like how there was too much sauce and it&nbsp;was really spicy and burned her mouth. I&nbsp;asked her why she almost finished the whole thing if&nbsp;it&nbsp;was so&nbsp;spicy. She didn’t say anything, so&nbsp;I just asked her if&nbsp;she was ready to&nbsp;admit&nbsp;it. She said&nbsp;no, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;left but&nbsp;I spotted her eating it&nbsp;from the other room. I&nbsp;asked her again and she laughed and finally told me&nbsp;that I’m a&nbsp;good chef.&nbsp;<a href=#>©&nbsp;ThrowRA-Barber&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></p><p>In&nbsp;my&nbsp;last year getting my&nbsp;degree, I&nbsp;scored a&nbsp;paid contract at&nbsp;a&nbsp;scientific organization where&nbsp;I was shown into a&nbsp;large empty <a href=# title=office data-link=tag>office</a> and told&nbsp;I could base myself there. I&nbsp;was the only student on&nbsp;this project, so&nbsp;I had the whole office to&nbsp;myself, with about 6&nbsp;desks. All of&nbsp;the desks were the same and mine had no&nbsp;better view than anyone else’s.</p><p>All went well for a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;weeks until a&nbsp;few other students moved into the room.&nbsp;2&nbsp;of&nbsp;them were perfectly reasonable and set themselves up&nbsp;at&nbsp;other desks. The third decided he&nbsp;liked my&nbsp;desk. Mine had my&nbsp;stationary on&nbsp;it, my&nbsp;posters on&nbsp;the wall around&nbsp;it, a&nbsp;clock, a&nbsp;telephone...</p><p>So&nbsp;one day&nbsp;I come in&nbsp;and this guy is&nbsp;sitting at&nbsp;my&nbsp;desk. My&nbsp;stuff was packed up&nbsp;and pushed to&nbsp;one side to&nbsp;make room for his stuff. I&nbsp;made some comment about it&nbsp;being my&nbsp;desk and his response was yeah, I&nbsp;won’t be&nbsp;here for long. I&nbsp;set myself up&nbsp;at&nbsp;another desk that day, although over the next few days&nbsp;I could tell my&nbsp;stuff had been moved around and unless&nbsp;I got to&nbsp;the building by&nbsp;a&nbsp;certain time, he&nbsp;would steal my&nbsp;desk again.</p><p>Unfortunately for that guy, one of&nbsp;the things&nbsp;I brought from home was a&nbsp;“Talking Wizard” talking calculator clock. Basically a&nbsp;black plastic box with a&nbsp;button. When you pressed the button, it&nbsp;would say “It&nbsp;is&nbsp;nine oh&nbsp;five A&nbsp;M.” The clock also had an&nbsp;alarm. When you set&nbsp;it, it&nbsp;would say “BEEP BEEP BEEP It&nbsp;is&nbsp;nine oh&nbsp;five A&nbsp;M&nbsp;BEEP BEEP BEEP It&nbsp;is&nbsp;nine oh&nbsp;five A&nbsp;M” and would keep repeating this for 30&nbsp;seconds very loudly. I&nbsp;set the alarm to&nbsp;go&nbsp;off mid-morning, put it&nbsp;in&nbsp;my&nbsp;desk drawer, and locked&nbsp;it. For extra pettiness, I&nbsp;also changed it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the wrong time.</p><p>They were sturdy desks. It&nbsp;was not possible to&nbsp;dismantle them or&nbsp;open them with a&nbsp;different key. I&nbsp;then took the key home and didn’t come back for another 3&nbsp;working days. When I&nbsp;returned&nbsp;I sat at&nbsp;my&nbsp;desk, opened the drawer, and turned the clock off before it&nbsp;could go&nbsp;off. When this guy came in&nbsp;he&nbsp;saw me&nbsp;and said, “Can you turn that clock off? There’s something locked in&nbsp;the desk and it&nbsp;scares me&nbsp;every day.” I&nbsp;said something snarky like “Sorry, it&nbsp;does sometimes go&nbsp;off when other people sit at&nbsp;my&nbsp;desk.” He&nbsp;never stole my&nbsp;desk again.&nbsp;<a href=#>©</a><a href=#>&nbsp;valiantfreak&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH54edaiq62xXZi8rrHBmpqkZaOpvLO1xKxkraCRqXqxvs6vnGafn6SxbsPIpaNmmZysrrq%2FjK2poq2dpbVuu9WeqWadpp65boSPanBybl8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
