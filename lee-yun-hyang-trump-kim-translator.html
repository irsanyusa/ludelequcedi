Bush and Barack Obama, and served Trump last November during a visit by South Korean President Moon Jae-in, according to The Korea Times. Lee was also <a href=# rel=noopener>reportedly</a> present with Trump to greet the three American detainees <a href=#>released</a> by North Korea last month.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The interpreter Dr. Yun-hyang Lee has been an unheralded stalwart in major U.S.-Korean negotiations. The US gov't spends hours honing perfect talking points, only to give short shrift to the translators who deliver them. But peace rests on the execution of nuance. <a href=#>#TrumpKim</a></p>— Frank Aum (@frankaum1) <a href=#>June 12, 2018</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Tuesday, Trump appeared to be in safe hands with Lee by his side during his meeting with Kim. The President emerged from the one-on-one <a href=#>saying</a> that he had an “excellent relationship” with the North Korean dictator. The two leaders went on to sign a joint agreement in which they committed to working “toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lee <a href=# rel=noopener>earned</a> a master’s degree in interpretation and translation from Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul and recieved a Ph.D. from the Faculty of Translation and Interpreting at the University of Geneva in 2009. She taught at the Monterey Institute of International Studies at Middlebury College in California and Ewha University in Seoul, and is a <a href=# rel=noopener>member</a> of the International Association of Conference Interpreters.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">She also served as an official Korean interpreter for the <a href=# rel=noopener>2008 Olympics</a> in Beijing, <a href=# rel=noopener>2010 Games</a> in Vancouver, and <a href=# rel=noopener>2018 Winter Games</a> in PyeongChang, South Korea.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rtx68mx3.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Despite her expertise, Lee’s task was not an easy one. She had to mediate between two leaders known for trading <a href=#>stinging insults</a>, and to interpret Trump’s impulsive manner of speaking. The extent of <a href=#>Kim’s English skills</a> are also not known, though the North Korean leader greeted Trump by saying “Nice to meet you, Mr. President.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=#>The Kim-Trump Summit Poses a Big Challenge for Interpreters</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lee is well aware of these risks. In 2015, she told South Korean newspaper JoongAng Ilbo that diplomatic interpretation doesn’t contain <a href=# rel=noopener>definite certainties</a> like “yes” and “no,” according to Bloomberg. “There’s only something in between,” she said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Another challenge of interpretation is conveying the little things, jokes, slang terms or colloquialisms, that can get lost in the conversation. Aum, the North Korea expert, said Lee’s expertise shines in this area.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“People in the U.S. Government don’t do a lot of work trying to find the right talking points to get the right messages to the other side. They assume everything translates 100%,” he said. “But there’s many times where little jokes or phrases don’t get picked up. She’s been excellent at picking up the nuances and making sure that the U.S. message is portrayed accurately.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Correction:</b> The original version of this story misstated the affiliation of the U.S. Institute of Peace.
