The Sept. 27-29 <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>survey</a> also found that 45 percent of U.S. adults support a Black actor taking on the role — though that was down 7 points from 2018.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Respondents were roughly split on support for a Hispanic or Asian Bond, while more adults opposed a female or gay Bond than supported one. Support for a Hispanic, Asian, female or gay Bond each showed little to no movement from the 2018 survey.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Though Black actress <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>Lashana Lynch will make history</a> as the first woman to earn the 007 title in “No Time to Die,” fans and cast members have for years called for the franchise to further diversify, suggesting A-list Black actors such as Idris Elba, Daniel Kaluuya and “Bridgerton” star Regé-Jean Page to succeed Craig as the next actual Bond.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Bond films remain popular, as evidenced by the early success of “No Time to Die” in the United Kingdom, where last weekend it earned the franchise’s <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>biggest opening to date</a>. In its 60-year history on screen, the Bond character has never been portrayed as anything other than a straight, white, British man.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Actor Ben Whishaw, who played “Q” in the three most recent Bond films, recently <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>called for an openly gay British actor</a> to be cast in the role, and suggested actors Luke Evans and Jonathan Bailey as candidates. Craig himself made headlines for saying he doesn’t believe a woman <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>should take on the role</a>, but that the entertainment industry should instead create better, original roles for women and performers of color.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Barbara Broccoli, longtime producer of the Bond franchise, seemingly issued the final verdict on the matter when she <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>said</a> that “James Bond is a male character.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6zwMico56rX5%2BurrHSZpmoppRisarCxKuqoqypYr2wuMs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
