My&nbsp;mom asked me&nbsp;to&nbsp;describe the woman, and&nbsp;I apparently described my&nbsp;mom’s great-grandmother perfectly. Down to&nbsp;the eye color. I&nbsp;had never met my&nbsp;great-great-grandmother, nor had&nbsp;I ever seen a&nbsp;picture of&nbsp;her. <a href=#>©&nbsp;Beans375&nbsp;/ reddit</a></p></li><li readability=11.714023831347><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;child who was always visiting my&nbsp;grandma’s, whenever&nbsp;I left the house, I’d wave next door to&nbsp;Ken who always sat by&nbsp;the bay window and looked out at&nbsp;the sea. One time&nbsp;I was leaving her house, and&nbsp;I was in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;my&nbsp;mom who’d stopped at&nbsp;the door to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;my&nbsp;gran. So&nbsp;I&nbsp;headed down the steps and toward the gate. I&nbsp;turn back and see Ken in&nbsp;the window. Big smile, as&nbsp;usual, waving at&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;give him a&nbsp;wave back. He&nbsp;stands&nbsp;up, gives me&nbsp;the thumbs-up, and wanders toward the back of&nbsp;the room. My&nbsp;mom comes walking down the steps and asks “Who are you waving&nbsp;at?” I&nbsp;replied “Ken.” To&nbsp;this day, <strong>I&nbsp;can remember my&nbsp;mom’s face. She just went white, but didn’t say anything to&nbsp;me.</strong> It&nbsp;wasn’t until a&nbsp;few weeks later that she plucked up&nbsp;the courage to&nbsp;tell me&nbsp;that Ken had passed away a&nbsp;few days prior to&nbsp;our visit to&nbsp;my&nbsp;grans. I&nbsp;don’t believe in&nbsp;ghosts, but&nbsp;I know&nbsp;I saw him. I&nbsp;can still picture his striped grey sweater with light stripes across&nbsp;it. Him waving and getting up&nbsp;out of&nbsp;his chair. <a href=#>©&nbsp;Ablemarrow87&nbsp;/ reddit</a></p></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/59b/899/e00c90562a997653234a84de57.jpg><ul readability=2.8736462093863><li>Once, I&nbsp;was changing my&nbsp;pants in&nbsp;my&nbsp;room before work and took off my&nbsp;belt.

No&nbsp;one else was in&nbsp;the room and&nbsp;I spent a&nbsp;good 10&nbsp;minutes looking for&nbsp;it, as&nbsp;I had simply set it&nbsp;on&nbsp;the floor.

I, of&nbsp;course, didn’t get&nbsp;it, but the memory of&nbsp;it&nbsp;stuck in&nbsp;my&nbsp;head. A&nbsp;few nights later, I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;<a href=# title=dream data-link=tag>dream</a> where&nbsp;I was playing with the helicopter, but as&nbsp;I was dreaming&nbsp;I realized it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;dream and stupid young me&nbsp;thought that if&nbsp;I put it&nbsp;under my&nbsp;pillow, it&nbsp;would still be&nbsp;there when&nbsp;I woke&nbsp;up. Afterward, I&nbsp;woke up&nbsp;and eagerly checked under the pillow to&nbsp;get&nbsp;it. For some reason, it&nbsp;was right where&nbsp;I left it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the dream. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;kid, I&nbsp;wasn’t surprised to&nbsp;find it&nbsp;there as&nbsp;it&nbsp;all made perfect sense to&nbsp;me&nbsp;then, but <strong>years later&nbsp;I have no&nbsp;clue how the toy helicopter actually got underneath the pillow</strong>. <a href=#>©&nbsp;Rawhited&nbsp;/ reddit</a></li><li readability=8.6111111111111>I&nbsp;turned to&nbsp;the other person in&nbsp;the room with&nbsp;me, who&nbsp;I barely knew, and said, “My&nbsp;sister is&nbsp;getting engaged right now,” without having the intent of&nbsp;speaking at&nbsp;all.<p><strong>He&nbsp;politely asked why&nbsp;I said that</strong>, and&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;shake my&nbsp;head and say, “I&nbsp;don’t know.”</p><p>A&nbsp;few days later&nbsp;I found up&nbsp;that, sure enough, at&nbsp;that exact moment on&nbsp;the far side of&nbsp;the world, she had said “yes” to&nbsp;Mr. Right.</p><p>I&nbsp;hadn’t even known she was dating someone. <a href=#>©&nbsp;bookeater/ reddit</a></p></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5fb/1ee/db58f859d8baf18aa63a625901.jpg><ul><li>One morning&nbsp;I woke up&nbsp;and noticed my&nbsp;<a href=# title=camera data-link=tag>camera</a> was on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;the sofa opposite my&nbsp;bed. I&nbsp;knew&nbsp;I didn’t put it&nbsp;there. I&nbsp;went over, picked it&nbsp;up, turned it&nbsp;on, and clicked the button to&nbsp;view photos. There were hundreds of&nbsp;photos of&nbsp;me&nbsp;sleeping, all seemingly taken from the back of&nbsp;the sofa. I&nbsp;was literally so&nbsp;freaked out, I&nbsp;couldn’t stop crying. I&nbsp;lived alone. It&nbsp;was just photo after photo of&nbsp;me&nbsp;sleeping. The photos were taken in&nbsp;“quick snap,” where the camera takes approximately one photo per second. <strong>I&nbsp;later realized the camera didn’t even have a&nbsp;“quick snap” setting,</strong> so&nbsp;technically it&nbsp;was impossible for the camera to&nbsp;take the photos at&nbsp;all. The timestamps suggest that all the photos were taken between 2&nbsp;AM and 3&nbsp;AM. I’ve never figured out what happened and how the camera got to&nbsp;the sofa. <a href=#>©&nbsp;Excellent-Raccoon-32&nbsp;/ reddit</a></li><li>I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;vivid memory of&nbsp;being at&nbsp;the Statue of&nbsp;Liberty as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child, on&nbsp;my&nbsp;dad’s shoulders, seeing the skyline of&nbsp;NYC.

I’ve always thought about this memory and talked about&nbsp;it, but <strong>my&nbsp;family denies that&nbsp;I ever went to&nbsp;NYC</strong>. I&nbsp;didn’t go&nbsp;for the first time until&nbsp;I was&nbsp;23, but strangely enough, when I&nbsp;went, I&nbsp;remembered everything just how it&nbsp;had been when&nbsp;I was there with my&nbsp;dad. <a href=#>©&nbsp;dryshampooforyou&nbsp;/ reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f3d/b56/59792d5dabb4b68cf6823f65e9.jpg><ul readability=0><li>When I&nbsp;was 10&nbsp;years old, I&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;school one day. <strong>I&nbsp;faked a&nbsp;stomachache so&nbsp;my&nbsp;grandmother would let me&nbsp;stay home.</strong> I’ve always been a&nbsp;bad liar, so&nbsp;my&nbsp;grandma tried to&nbsp;call my&nbsp;bluff. She told me&nbsp;that if&nbsp;I was too sick for school then she would be&nbsp;scheduling me&nbsp;a&nbsp;doctor appointment. 3&nbsp;hours later, I&nbsp;was rushed into emergency surgery. My&nbsp;fake illness was actually appendicitis and it&nbsp;was so&nbsp;inflamed that if&nbsp;I hadn’t come in&nbsp;that day my&nbsp;appendix would have ruptured, potentially killing&nbsp;me.
