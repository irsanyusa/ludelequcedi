It&nbsp;was made to&nbsp;attract dogs’ attention. The ad&nbsp;used special high-frequency sounds. They were inaudible to&nbsp;the human ear, but dogs could hear them very well.</p><p>The idea was simple: a&nbsp;pooch gets so&nbsp;entranced by&nbsp;the commercial that owners can’t but notice&nbsp;it. And the next dog food they buy is&nbsp;the advertised product. In&nbsp;theory, the idea sounded promising. In&nbsp;reality, most dogs showed no&nbsp;reaction whatsoever. Meaning ads can’t probably manipulate pets as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;influence people.</p><p>But even though this experiment was a&nbsp;failure, dogs still do&nbsp;find watching&nbsp;TV interesting. You might have noticed your fluffy companion react to&nbsp;<a href=# title=animals data-link=tag>animals</a>, moving objects, and other images appearing on&nbsp;the screen. It’s almost as&nbsp;if&nbsp;they see the same things you&nbsp;do! If&nbsp;we&nbsp;talk about colors, TV&nbsp;and reality don’t look different to&nbsp;dogs. They see the world in&nbsp;shades of&nbsp;yellow and blue and can’t pick out green and red hues. Plus, canine vision is&nbsp;somewhat blurred.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/1df/9e4/0e38e55870b8a0a3e43fe294fb.png><p>Dogs process what’s happening on&nbsp;the screen in&nbsp;a&nbsp;different way than you&nbsp;do. When you watch something, your brain needs <strong>16&nbsp;to&nbsp;20</strong>&nbsp;video <strong>frames per second</strong> to&nbsp;detect movement. For your pooch, this number must be&nbsp;more than <strong>70&nbsp;frames per second</strong>. Let’s say, your pet is&nbsp;seated in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;an&nbsp;old TV. In&nbsp;this case, what the animal sees looks like a&nbsp;flip <strong>book</strong>. If&nbsp;it’s a&nbsp;modern television, your pup is&nbsp;likely to&nbsp;be&nbsp;much more interested. Because modern&nbsp;TV sets have a&nbsp;faster video frame rate.</p><p>As&nbsp;for the content itself, dogs react to&nbsp;the same stuff that would attract their attention in&nbsp;real life. It&nbsp;can be&nbsp;squeaking toys, commands, and other dogs barking, growling, yipping, and whatnot. If&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV screen isn’t showing anything related to&nbsp;dogs, though, your pet will probably remain completely uninterested.</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;<strong>2017</strong>&nbsp;experiment, dogs were offered to&nbsp;watch different activities happening on&nbsp;three screens. The animals didn’t show any preferences for one screen over the others. In&nbsp;fact, they didn’t look even a&nbsp;tiny bit curious or&nbsp;eager to&nbsp;spend some time in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;any of&nbsp;the TVs. It&nbsp;might be&nbsp;because dogs have a&nbsp;super short&nbsp;TV attention span. Usually, they only look at&nbsp;the screen for a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;seconds at&nbsp;a&nbsp;time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ee1/cd5/10efcc5794bff60db1ab712842.png><p>On&nbsp;the other hand, hunting dogs, which are innately interested in&nbsp;moving objects, can get more captivated. While those canines that mostly rely on&nbsp;smell will get bored in&nbsp;no&nbsp;time. Other pets, like cats or&nbsp;parrots, also seem to&nbsp;enjoy an&nbsp;occasional&nbsp;TV show or&nbsp;two. Many parrot owners are sure their birds love watching TV. They get excited when a&nbsp;particular commercial is&nbsp;on. They can even start flapping their wings, dancing, or&nbsp;whistling.</p><p>But what do&nbsp;they see on&nbsp;the screen? A&nbsp;parrot’s vision is&nbsp;different from yours in&nbsp;several ways. For one thing, its eyes are on&nbsp;the sides of&nbsp;the head, not facing forward. It&nbsp;helps the bird to&nbsp;see a&nbsp;larger area and protect itself from enemies. But even though parrots have a&nbsp;broader vision, they can’t perceive depth well enough.</p><p>It&nbsp;means that images on&nbsp;a&nbsp;widescreen&nbsp;TV look much flatter to&nbsp;them than they do&nbsp;to&nbsp;you. When you’re watching&nbsp;TV, you see one constant image. But for parrots, the screen is&nbsp;constantly flickering at&nbsp;a&nbsp;fast speed. And the coolest thing: these birds can see ultraviolet light. But the human eye can’t detect&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/470/4d0/d4417e5b12a2e1e32626ca3e58.png><p>And how about cats? These animals are natural hunters. That’s why they most often react to&nbsp;the images of&nbsp;rodents and birds. In&nbsp;one study, more than <strong>100 cats</strong> watched&nbsp;TV for <strong>3&nbsp;hours</strong> a&nbsp;day. The felines were split into 5&nbsp;focus groups. Each group had its own program to&nbsp;view, which ranged from the footage of&nbsp;people and animals moving, to&nbsp;a&nbsp;blank screen.</p><p>The average time the cats spent watching&nbsp;TV was a&nbsp;bit more than <strong>6%</strong>. The most popular were the shows about animals. If&nbsp;your cat likes staring at&nbsp;the screen from time to&nbsp;time, try not to&nbsp;let it&nbsp;alone in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the TV. The chances are your pet’s hunting instincts will take over.</p><p>And when it&nbsp;pounces to&nbsp;catch a&nbsp;bird flying on&nbsp;the screen, your television will end up&nbsp;on&nbsp;the floor. All in&nbsp;all, it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;not bad that our pets have such limited screen time. But this whole TV-watching situation makes me&nbsp;think. How do&nbsp;different creatures see the world around them?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/afe/b43/497e285011ba07c9d2d87822d1.png><p><a href=# title=Fish data-link=tag>Fish</a>’s eyes are not that different from ours. But they’re covered with a&nbsp;protective film. Otherwise, fish wouldn’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;see clearly underwater. Like in&nbsp;the human eye, there are rods for black and white vision and cones for color vision in&nbsp;the fish’s eyes. Some fish species, like tank-dwelling goldfish, can also see ultraviolet! Fish’s eyes are also designed in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;way that everything located nearby looks bigger than it&nbsp;really&nbsp;is.</p><p>Snakes have rather poor vision. That’s why they have to&nbsp;stick out their tongues to&nbsp;get an&nbsp;idea of&nbsp;what’s going on&nbsp;around them. On&nbsp;the Bright Side (heh-heh), snakes can spot thermal radiation amazingly well. All living creatures emit this kind of&nbsp;radiation. At&nbsp;night, this natural ability is&nbsp;ten times more effective than any modern night vision device. But during the day, snakes can only react to&nbsp;movement.</p><p>Rats and mice don’t have perfect vision either. It’s quite blurry, with bad depth perception. These rodents perceive colors a&nbsp;bit like people with red-green colorblindness. Everything looks bluish. And the colors they&nbsp;DO see are kinda faded. Also, rats and mice are likely to&nbsp;connect smells with what they see at&nbsp;the moment. They mostly perceive the world with the help of&nbsp;their whiskers, through touch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/128/4d4/319c24524f8e22e32685d70efc.png><p>Mooove over! Cows can see the world in&nbsp;much less vibrant colors than most people. Only a&nbsp;few hues look bright, the rest are faded. These animals also don’t see things clearly enough. It’s because they can’t focus their eyes as&nbsp;fast as&nbsp;people&nbsp;do. Plus, cows need more time to&nbsp;process visual information.</p><p>They have poor depth perception because of&nbsp;their limited vertical vision. It’s <strong>60</strong>&nbsp;degrees vs&nbsp;<strong>140</strong> degrees in&nbsp;humans. You might have noticed cows stop before walking across shadows. That’s because they can’t tell whether it’s a&nbsp;shadow or&nbsp;a&nbsp;ditch or&nbsp;a&nbsp;hole in&nbsp;the ground.</p><p>Horses can see almost 360&nbsp;degrees. But they have two blind spots&nbsp;— a&nbsp;small one directly in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;their noses and the other behind their tails. Horses don’t see colors as&nbsp;bright as&nbsp;we&nbsp;do. Their color deficiency makes it&nbsp;hard for them to&nbsp;spot some objects. They also can’t distinguish red colors. People can see more hues than bees, but bees have a&nbsp;broader range of&nbsp;color vision. You base your color combinations on&nbsp;blue, green, and red. And bees&nbsp;— on&nbsp;blue, green, and ultraviolet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/279/22b/1a9f1452dc8f8ab7a45624a52f.png><p>These insects don’t have special photoreceptors to&nbsp;see the red color. But they can distinguish yellow, orange, and a&nbsp;unique color called “<strong>bees’ purple</strong>.” That’s a&nbsp;mixture of&nbsp;yellow and ultraviolet light. Bees see color five times faster than people. Their color vision is&nbsp;not only the speediest in&nbsp;the animal world. It&nbsp;also helps them find natural “landing strips” invisible to&nbsp;people.</p><p>Flies’ eyes don’t move. But their spherical shape and the way they stick out of&nbsp;the bugs’ heads give flies an&nbsp;almost 360-degree vision. These insects can’t focus and are short-sighted. Just like some people I&nbsp;know. But the coolest thing about how they see the world? It&nbsp;resembles a&nbsp;mosaic&nbsp;— thousands of&nbsp;teeny images that together create the whole picture.</p><p>Flies are so&nbsp;jumpy for a&nbsp;reason. Even though these bugs don’t see well, they’re great at&nbsp;picking up&nbsp;movement. This ability helps them flee in&nbsp;the blink of&nbsp;an&nbsp;eye. Um, that’s <strong>flee</strong> as&nbsp;in&nbsp;“get away”, <strong>not flea</strong> as&nbsp;in&nbsp;the “bugs on&nbsp;your dog”. Are we&nbsp;clear? Good.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/fb8/7bd/735d685ca8bda48a0cd99a170b.png><p>Moving on. Sharks see the world in&nbsp;monochrome. These creatures are a&nbsp;bit short-sighted. But sharks only need the sense of&nbsp;sight once they’re closing in&nbsp;on&nbsp;their soon-to-be dinner. And in&nbsp;dim light, a&nbsp;shark can see almost 10&nbsp;times better than you&nbsp;do.</p><p>Garden snails’ eyes don’t focus or&nbsp;see colors. But these slow creatures can make out other living beings coming close. Snails also know how to&nbsp;navigate toward dark, safe places. All thanks to&nbsp;their ability to&nbsp;analyze the difference in&nbsp;light intensity. Adult giant clams don’t move. They attach themselves to&nbsp;a&nbsp;rock or&nbsp;coral and watch the world through hundreds of&nbsp;tiny pinhole eyes. Those are situated along the edges of&nbsp;their soft bodies.</p><p>Clams can distinguish three different colors. But unfortunately, they can’t combine the information they receive. That’s why they see bright and colorful but totally shapeless images. But that’s no&nbsp;slam on&nbsp;the clam. And, they’re also delicious.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLGwecOonqxlkaOxbq%2FArapmqpWWua3FjLCYrZuYYsG3eZdqanJtaWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
