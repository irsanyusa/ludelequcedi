With this level of engagement, its renewal was almost predicted by its avid fans.</p><p>Additionally, Clarkson’s two-minute segment, Kellyoke, has been a glorious feature of the show, stealing viral spots online. As of writing, her “Breakaway” duet with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sam Smith</a> has reached 1.4 million views on YouTube.</p><p>“With more than 500 hours viewed on broadcast, cable and digital platforms since its launch, The Kelly Clarkson Show has been a home for stories that entertain, inspire important conversations and connect with loyal viewers across multiple generations in meaningful ways,” stated Tracie Wilson, Executive Vice President of Syndication Studios.</p><p>Wilson described Clarkson to be “one of the brightest stars of our time.” Meanwhile, Chairman of NBCUniversal Valari Staab said that Clarkson’s genuine warmth and natural curiosity led the talk show to be fun. Consequently, the show vows to continue its well-established success and legacy.</p><p>At present, the talk show airs in 211 local markets nationwide. While it primarily engages adults under ages 25-54, the show amuses a diverse set of people. In its three previous seasons, The Kelly Clarkson Show has racked up 13 Daytime Emmy Award wins.

Apparently, this will be the last time that Clarkson and Blake Shelton will pit against each other as coaches due to Shelton’s retirement.</p><p>“I am so excited to be back with my Voice family!” Clarkson said. “Let’s do this, Team Kelly!”</p><p>Gracing the show from season 14 to 21, Team Kelly has already obtained four wins. Yet, whether season 23 is another trophy reserved for Clarkson’s artist is unknown for now.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Original_SnoopDogg_KellyClarkson_Trae-Patton_NBC.jpg alt="Snoop Dogg Disproves Blunt Roller’s Claim, Reveals How Much He Actually Smokes" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZqOVobm6ecKlmKujo6S7br%2FHqK5mqpWjsrixw2aroaqfqrSpeZFpaW5n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
