They can be found in <strong>Senegal, South Africa, Egypt </strong>and<strong> Nigeria</strong>. Meet the seven wonders of Africa:</p><p>African Renaissance Monument</p><p>Located in one of the twin hills in the <strong>Mamelles</strong> district of<strong> Dakar, </strong>Senegal stands a huge, magnificent sculpture. At 160 feet, it surpasses the height of the Statue of Liberty and easily the tallest statue in Africa.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>It is a depiction of a man with a muscular man holding a baby in one arm and a woman in the other. The baby is said to be a reflection of the future while the woman represents the past.</p><p>The monument was unveiled in 2010 by the former Senegalese president <strong>Abdoulaye Wade.</strong></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-66d6106b-1b62-465e-8b48-629db0c85381 data-caption="The African Renaissance Monument is the first wonder of Africa"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/iBFktkqTURBXy9kMzhlODNiZDU2OWQwZDY0ODQ1MzU5MTEzMjAzZTFjZC5qcGVnkZUCzQLuzQH2wsM></span><p>The Great Sphinx of Giza</p><p>Second on the list is this 66 feet sculpture on the Giza Plateau on the west bank of the <strong>Nile </strong>in <strong>Giza, </strong><a href=# id=f9ce16d1-8275-4776-80e7-2b7f0507a235>Egypt.</a> It is commonly referred to as the Sphinx of Giza or simply the Sphinx.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Known as one of the largest, oldest and most famous monuments in the world, it takes the shape of a reclining sphinx, which is a mythical creature with a human head wearing the Nemes headdress of a pharaoh and the body of a lion.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-e3a152c1-3b29-4b40-a31a-a88264569a98 data-caption="The Great Sphinx of Giza is believed to have been carved from only one piece of rock"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/BbmktkqTURBXy81OGY5YmI0MDQ4MDA3ZjQyNjcyMWRjMTNmMjExZDFkNC5qcGVnkZUCzQJ4zQGmwsM></span><p>There are several claims surrounding this statute. One is that the face of the Sphinx represents Pharoah<strong> Khafre Khafra,</strong> an extremely ancient Egyptian king. Another is that it has been here since the beginning of time when the gods lived with human beings on earth.</p><p>Colossi of Memnon</p><p>The third wonder of Africa can also be found in Egypt on the west side of the River Nile. Standing at 60 feet are two massive stone statues of the Pharaoh<strong> Amenhotep III. </strong>It is believed that he ruled Egypt during the Dynasty XVIII. It was originally built in the 14th century BC.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>One intriguing belief held by Greeks and Romans is that it used to make crying sounds at sunrise. This noise is said to be the cries of a woman called<strong> Eos</strong> (the goddess of dawn) who mourned the death of her son <strong>Memnon,</strong> a mortal Greek, by shedding tears every morning.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-67766d1a-2f24-417c-9449-ae40c8ef169e data-caption="The Colossi of Memnon has survived for over 3,400 years&nbsp; "><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/0PGktkqTURBXy83ZWFhMmI3OTcyMmVlODY0Yzc1YWEyMzVlMzQ4MjlkMi5qcGVnkZUCzQJJzQGGwsM></span><p>These cries eventually resulted in the statues being named The Colossi at Memnon after the goddess' high-pitched sounds. According to <strong>How Stuff Works</strong>, the sounds stopped after Roman emperor <strong>Septimius Severus,</strong> repaired the damage caused by an earthquake damage many centuries ago.</p><p>Queen Moremi Statue of Liberty</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The fourth African wonder can be found in the largest country in Africa-Nigeria.
