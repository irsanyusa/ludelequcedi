From cup sizes to band sizes to cup types and everything in between, there’s a lot to keep in mind when it comes to bra shopping—and even more to keep in mind when shopping for strapless bras, since a crucial piece of support is missing.</p><p>To learn more about shopping for the <a rel=alternate href=#>best bras</a>, and more specifically the best strapless bras, we spoke with bra experts Ra’el Cohen, co-founder and resident bra expert at <a rel=nofollow href=#>ThirdLove</a> (which made our list for one of the <a rel=alternate href=#>best lingerie brands</a>), Kimmay Caldwell, undergarment educator at <a rel=nofollow href=#>HurrayKimmay.com</a>, and Jené Luciani Sena, bestselling author of <a rel=nofollow href=#>The Bra Book</a>. They also provided us with some of their favorite strapless bras. We kept those—and our personal favorites—in mind when creating this list.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-strapless-bras>Our top picks for the best strapless bras</h2><h3>Best affordable strapless bra: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Maidenform Custom Lift Strapless Underwire Bra</a></h3><p>When it comes to affordable strapless bras, the Maidenform Custom Lift Strapless Underwire Bra is my go-to. Priced at under $22, this demi-cup bra keeps my breasts in place all day, even when walking tens of miles each week around Walt Disney World theme parks (which I often do) thanks to its Stay Put Power Band. I appreciate the smooth feel of this bra from its nylon and elastane fabric, and I particularly like how it lifts my breasts without feeling uncomfortable.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Band sizes: 32 - 38</li><li>Cup sizes: A - D</li><li>Number of colors: 3</li><li>Style: Strapless</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Smooth</li><li>Stay-put power band</li><li>Removable straps</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Not many color options</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Although it's a more affordable option when compared to some other strapless bras, this bra offers adequate support resulting from its Stay Put Power Band.</p><h3>Most comfortable strapless bra: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Chantelle Norah Comfort Strapless Convertible Bra</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Most comfortable strapless bra</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/us.chantelle.com/media/catalog/product/cache/3/image/415x553/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/c/1/c13f50-0rg-ft.jpg alt="Chantelle Norah Comfort Strapless Convertible Bra" title="Chantelle Norah Comfort Strapless Convertible Bra" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>Chantelle Norah Comfort Strapless Convertible Bra</h3></p><p>As far as comfortable strapless bras go, the Chantelle Norah Comfort Strapless Convertible Bra is a solid choice. “I really love the softness and cushioned underwire,” says Caldwell. In addition to its cushioned underwire, this bra is made with lightweight cups and a silicone-lined back which provides a secure fit. Since this bra comes in two colors, cup sizes B to G, and band sizes 32 to 40, this bra can be worn comfortably by bra wearers of many sizes.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Band sizes: 32 - 40</li><li>Cup sizes: B - G</li><li>Number of colors: 2</li><li>Style: Strapless</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Cannot be machine-washed</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>If you seek a comfortable strapless bra, it’s hard to go wrong with this one since it's available in many sizes, features lightweight cups, and is equipped with a cushioned underwire.</p><h3>Best strapless bra for large breasts: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Elomi Plus Size Smooth Underwire Molded Strapless Bra</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best strapless bra for large breasts</span></p><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/slimages.macysassets.com/is/image/MCY/products/9/optimized/16902899_fpx.tif?op_sharpen=1&amp;amp;wid=700&amp;amp;hei=855&amp;amp;fit=fit" alt="Elomi Plus Size Smooth Underwire Molded Strapless Bra" title="Elomi Plus Size Smooth Underwire Molded Strapless Bra" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>Elomi Plus Size Smooth Underwire Molded Strapless Bra</h3></p><p>While many strapless bras out there are able to support large breasts, not as many do as great of a job as the Plus Size Smooth Underwire Molded Strapless Bra from Elomi. “This bra is smooth and supportive for full busts,” explains Caldwell. That is in part due to its back boning and no-slip band.</p><p>What makes this bra such a good bra for large breasts: It’s designed with large breasts in mind as it's made with molded foam cups with a sweetheart neckline and in sizes ranging from 32GG to 44FF.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Band sizes: 32 - 44</li><li>Cup sizes: DD - J</li><li>Number of colors: Two</li><li>Style: Strapless</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Available in larger sizes for bra wearers with larger breasts</li><li>Cups form a sweetheart neckline</li><li>Back boning</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Caldwell recommends this strapless bra made with back boning and molded foam cups for people with larger breasts, as it’s both smooth and supportive for optimal comfort.</p><h3>Best strapless bra for small breasts: <a rel=nofollow href=#>The Little Bra Company Sascha Petite Strapless Bra</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best strapless bra for small breasts</span></p><p><h3 class=title>The Little Bra Company Women's Petite Sascha Strapless Lace Bra Black 38A</h3></p><p>Individuals with those smaller A to C cup sizes will appreciate the Sascha Petite Strapless Bra from The Little Bra Company, a company that focuses on making the best bras for small breasts. I like how this strapless demi-cup bra contains push-up padding that can be taken out depending on one’s preference. Regardless of whether you choose to keep it in or remove it, this bra maintains a seamless appearance perfect for wearing under any shirt, dress, or any other kind of top.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Band sizes: 28 - 38</li><li>Cup sizes: A - C</li><li>Number of colors: 3</li><li>Style: Strapless</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Removable push-up padding</li><li>Has an invisible underwire</li><li>Seamless appearance</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>All of the colors are made with floral mesh lace</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>If you’re shopping for bras for small breasts, this strapless bra is a great option as it contains removable push-up padding and an invisible underwire.</p><h3>Best strapless push-up bra: <a rel=nofollow href=#>On Gossamer Beautifully Basic Strapless Bra</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best strapless push-up bra</span></p><p><h3 class=title>OnGossamer Women's Beautifully Basic Strapless Bra, Champagne, 36D</h3></p><p>When shopping for strapless bras, I typically look for those which offer some level of push-up. However, it’s not always easy to find one that pushes breasts up as well as the Beautifully Basic Strapless Bra from On Gossamer. Caldwell recommends this strapless bra as it offers a “subtle push-up effect and is super smooth.” We love this strapless bra as it is equipped with lightly padded cups and a beautiful lace frame. Regardless of whether you buy this strapless bra in Champagne or Black, you'll immediately notice its push-up effect.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Band sizes: 30 - 36</li><li>Cup sizes: B - DD</li><li>Number of colors: 2</li><li>Style: Strapless push-up</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Lace frame</li><li>Lightly padded cups</li><li>Contains multiple neckline loops</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Not available in vibrant colors</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>This strapless push-up bra is a suitable option if you’re looking for some elevation, thanks to its contour cups and light padding.</p><h3>Best wireless strapless bra: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Soma Enbliss Wireless Stay Put Multi-Way Strapless Bra</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best wireless strapless bra</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Soma Enbliss Wireless Stay Put Multi-Way Strapless Bra</h3></p><p>Although the Wireless Stay Put Multi-Way Strapless Bra from Soma Enbliss offers full coverage and is available in a plethora of sizes, the best part is that it’s a wire-free bra. (It kind of looks and feels like a hybrid between a bra and the <a rel=alternate href=#>best sports bra</a>.) Since this bra doesn’t contain any wires, its exposed spandex lining works to keep breasts in place. And, we love that this bra comes in pink, not a color typically offered when it comes to strapless bras.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Band sizes: 32 - 42</li><li>Cup sizes: A - G</li><li>Number of colors: 5</li><li>Style: Strapless</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Wire-free</li><li>Full coverage cups</li><li>Available in a wide range of sizes</li><li>Available in pink</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Fabric rolling may occur</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Whether you wear an A or G cup (or are shopping for someone who does), this strapless, full-coverage, wireless bra will keep breasts in place from the moment it’s put on to the moment it’s taken off.</p><h3>Best supportive strapless bra: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Wacoal Red Carpet Convertible Strapless Bra</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best supportive strapless bra</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Wacoal Red Carpet Convertible Strapless Bra in Black at Nordstrom, Size 38Ddd</h3></p><p>The Wacoal Red Carpet Convertible Strapless Bra (recommended by Caldwell) is show-stopping when it comes to support. “This strapless bra is an overall hurray in my book,” says Caldwell. “And that’s because of its reinforced band with flexible boning, padded contour cup, and great underwire.”</p><p>Plus, this full coverage strapless bra keeps the sides feeling and looking smooth (and comfortable) while wearing—a bonus, as I dislike the bulging on the sides when wearing strapless bras.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Band sizes: 30 - 44</li><li>Cup sizes: B - H</li><li>Number of colors: 7</li><li>Style: Strapless</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>It’s contour cups</li><li>Minimizes bulging</li><li>Available in many colors</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>It may have a tighter feel</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>The Wacoal Women’s Red Carpet Convertible Strapless Bra is the best strapless bra for those who are looking for great support without any digging or bulging.</p><h3>Best strapless bra for heavy breasts: <a rel=nofollow href=#>PARFAIT Elissa Longline Strapless Bra</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best strapless bra for heavy breasts</span></p><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/slimages.macysassets.com/is/image/MCY/products/9/optimized/25834339_fpx.tif?op_sharpen=1&amp;amp;wid=700&amp;amp;hei=855&amp;amp;fit=fit" alt="PARFAIT Elissa Longline Strapless Bra" title="PARFAIT Elissa Longline Strapless Bra" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>PARFAIT Elissa Longline Strapless Bra</h3></p><p>This longline bra from Parfait is a go-to for heavy breasts as “the longline adds extra support and the molded cup is firm, with firm underwire support,” says Caldwell. Although it may be a more expensive piece, it’s worth it for people with heavier breasts since the longline nature provides additional support and stability and smooths out the back for a comfortable wearing experience. Make sure to note the sizing is based on UK measurements, so use the size chart to convert to a US size if that’s what you’re familiar with.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Band sizes: 32 - 42</li><li>Cup sizes: B - K</li><li>Number of colors: 4</li><li>Style: Strapless</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Smooths the back</li><li>Several hook and eye back closures</li><li>Can be worn as a crop top</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>People with heavier breasts often need the extra support this longline bra provides, and does so via several closures and firm underwire.</p><h3>Best strapless bandeau bra: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Cosabella Never Say Never Curvy Flirtie Bandeau Bra</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best strapless bandeau bra</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Cosabella Women's Never Say Never Curvy Flirtie Bandeau Bra, Black, Small, Lace Bralette</h3></p><p>Cosabella is known for its hand-crafted bras including the Never Say Never Curvy Flirtie Bandeau Bra. Caldwell recommends this bra, which has a scalloped lace design. Although this bandeau won’t provide breasts with the most possible support, reviewers note it’s a suitable piece for those days when you plan on lounging around or are in need of some extra coverage under a dress. I love a good bandeau bra like this once since all you have to do is pull it on over your head and it’s ready to go—you can say goodbye to those annoying clasps. Pair it with your <a rel=alternate href=#>best cotton underwear</a> for an extremely comfy lounge set.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Band sizes: N/A</li><li>Cup sizes: N/A</li><li>Sizes: XS - X-Large</li><li>Number of colors: 18</li><li>Style: Bandeau</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Pull-over application</li><li>Multiple color options, though Amazon only offers eight</li><li>Designed for fuller busts</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Doesn’t follow standard bra sizing</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Although it might not offer the most support, this bandeau bra from Cosabella is an ideal strapless bra for those looking for a comfortable wearing experience without wires and clasps.</p><h3>Best strapless convertible bra: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Maurices SmoothBliss Lace Trim Strapless Bra</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best strapless convertible bra</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Maurices SmoothBliss Lace Trim Strapless Bra</h3></p><p>Convertible bras are great because you choose how you want to wear them, and strapless convertible bras are even better. I recommend this convertible bra made with smooth micro fabric and lace trim because it comes with straps that could be added if desired and worn in a variety of ways. Plus, as someone who has a medium-sized chest and medium-sized breasts, its wider bottom band provides me with more security and support that gives me extra peace of mind.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Band sizes: 32 - 42</li><li>Cup sizes: B - DD</li><li>Number of colors: 3</li><li>Style: Convertible strapless</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Its adjustable straps can be removed</li><li>Made with a wider bottom band</li><li>Machine washable</li><li>Affordable</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Lack of color options</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>If you frequently adjust your bra throughout the day, I recommend this convertible bra as it provides ample support and comes with straps that could be added and worn in a variety of ways.</p><h3>Best low cut strapless bra: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Cleo by Panache Koko Strapless Bra</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best low cut strapless bra</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Cleo by Panache Cleo Women's Koko Strapless Bra, Caramel, 34G</h3></p><p>Low-cut bra lovers should consider the Koko Strapless from Cleo by Panache, especially if they wear D cups or larger, says Caldwell. Although it can only be hand washed, this bra is made comfortable thanks to its use of foam on the front and sides. I especially like the ribbon which sits at the bottom of its plunge as it adds a cute touch to the garment.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Band sizes: 28 - 38</li><li>Cup sizes: D - G</li><li>Number of colors: 2</li><li>Style: Strapless (plunge)</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Its ribbon underneath the plunge</li><li>Foam helps secure fit</li><li>Detachable straps</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Can only be hand washed</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>If you’re on the lookout for a low-cut strapless bra, consider this one as it’s adorned with a ribbon near the plunge cut and maintains a secure fit resulting from its incorporation of foam at its front and sides.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-choosing-a-strapless-bra>What to consider when choosing a strapless bra</h2><h3>Your daily attire</h3><p>It’s important to keep your wardrobe in mind when shopping for the best bras. “Consider the clothes you want to wear with it,” says Cohen. “Are you looking for a piece to wear with a plunging neckline or just a solution for strapless dresses?”</p><p>In addition to taking into account the style of the pieces you wear most often, consider their colors. “I recommend having one black strapless bra to wear under dark clothes and one neutral tone strapless bra to wear under lighter clothes,” adds Cohen.</p><h3>Cup shape</h3><p>As is the case with t-shirt bras, strapless bras are often made with various cup shapes including demi cups, contour cups, and full cups to name a few. “You may want to look for molded cups for some shaping and an elastic band plus an underwire, especially if you’re busty,” explains Luciani Sena.</p><h3>Support</h3><p>Support should be a factor when bra shopping, but particularly when strapless bra shopping, as they don’t have straps—often the pieces that provide the most support. “Silicone lining (aka non-slip grip) is pretty standard and should go all the way around the perimeter of the bra so it doesn’t go south,” says Luciani Sena. She also advises keeping an eye out for bras with more hooks and side-boning.</p><h2 id=how-we-chose-the-best-strapless-bras>How we chose the best strapless bras</h2><p>To find the best strapless bras, we researched strapless bras on the market from top brands including those sold on Amazon. Additionally, we spoke with several bra experts to consider their recommendations regarding strapless bras in various categories. We also incorporated some of our favorite strapless bras which we’ve personally tested and have worn for extended periods of time.</p><h2 id=how-should-a-strapless-bra-fit>How should a strapless bra fit?</h2><p>When it comes to the fit of a strapless bra, “it should feel secure but not too tight around the band and the cups should allow the breasts to swell slightly at the top without the cup edges digging in,” explains Cohen. Furthermore, the way a strapless bra should fit will depend on whether it has an underwire. “If it has an underwire, it should be on the body just around the bust. It should never rest on the breast or slip down under it,” adds Caldwell.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Should I get a bigger or smaller size strapless bra?</h3><p>When shopping for a strapless bra, Caldwell advises you should do your best to find one that fits. That said, keep in mind “bands tend to run a bit tighter in strapless bras to help give enough support,” says Cohen. “If you do not want the band to be as snug, you can size up one band for a little more room. However, if you're seeking more support, I would stick with your current size.”</p><h3>How do I find the right strapless bra fit?</h3><p>There are many ways you can find the right strapless bra fit. “You’ll want to be measured and have your actual current size as a guideline,” says Luciani Sena. Luckily, there are several ways you can determine your bra size if you don’t already know it or think it may need to be updated. If you’re unable to visit a bra retailer for an in-person fitting, Cohen recommends measuring yourself at home before using an online bra calculator.</p><h3>When should you wear a strapless bra?</h3><p>Although strapless bras can really be worn whenever you want, Cohen suggests you “wear a strapless bra anytime you have a strapless dress or top. Strapless bras are also great when you have a top with skinny or tricky straps that will expose regular bra straps.” I most often wear strapless bras with tube tops and dresses.</p><h3>How do you keep a strapless bra from falling down?</h3><p>There are several ways you can keep a strapless bra from falling down. Cohen advises the bra’s band is snug and that its inside surface contains silicone elastic and exposed spandex for extra gripping. Additionally, “you’ll also want to be sure not to wear any lotions or oils so you don’t negate the grip,” says Luciani Sena.</p><h3>What’s the difference between a strapless bra and a bandeau?</h3><p>Although strapless bras and bandeau bras may appear to be similar as neither have straps, there are a couple of differences to be aware of. “Strapless bras can have different necklines like balconette, plunge, or demi and they typically have a back opening for adjustability whereas bandeaus usually have a straight neckline and are often pullover styles without adjustability or back openings,” explains Cohen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lo6m%2ForzLnqqsZZKnrrR7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
