His dad, Rocky “Soulman” Johnson was a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the WWF Superstars of&nbsp;Wrestling, which meant he&nbsp;traveled a&nbsp;lot. At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;14, Dwayne and his mom Ata relocated to&nbsp;Honolulu, Hawaii, but despite his dad’s successful career, the family struggled financially, and his mom was struggling with work. Dwayne, at&nbsp;the time, wasn’t helping the situation much either, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;was always getting himself into trouble with the police.</p><p>“That was the <a href=#>tipping point</a>,” he&nbsp;says. “It&nbsp;was about, ’<strong>What can&nbsp;I control with these 2&nbsp;hands?’ The only thing&nbsp;I could do&nbsp;was <a href=# title=train data-link=tag>train</a> and build my&nbsp;body. </strong>The successful men&nbsp;I knew were men who built their bodies.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/85b/56e/d7670657c0a1af3a3c094b1d7b.jpg><p>He&nbsp;was <a href=#>angry at&nbsp;his father</a> for being absent and forcing him to&nbsp;move around a&nbsp;lot, but his father had taught him how to&nbsp;wrestle and introduced him to&nbsp;the gym. Young Johnson hopped from school to&nbsp;school all over America. When he&nbsp;was forced to&nbsp;leave Hawaii and move to&nbsp;Nashville, TN, he&nbsp;was already 6’4 with a&nbsp;“creepy mustache” and other students and teachers would avoid him because they thought he&nbsp;was an&nbsp;<a href=#>undercover cop</a>.</p><p><h2>His football career was a&nbsp;very dark period of&nbsp;his life.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e47/9a1/87b7ed5e15afe52f953bb2ae46.jpg><p>Dwayne eventually ended up&nbsp;at&nbsp;Freedom High School in&nbsp;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. His intimidating figure got him in&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;trouble with other kids, and teachers alike. He&nbsp;had an&nbsp;argument with Jody Cwik, a&nbsp;teacher, for using the teacher’s bathroom, but he&nbsp;realized his mistake and apologized for it&nbsp;the next day, which got him an&nbsp;invitation to&nbsp;play <a href=#>football</a>.</p><p>That interaction with his teacher led to&nbsp;a&nbsp;massive improvement in&nbsp;Dwayne’s life. Not only did he&nbsp;start falling in&nbsp;love with football, but his grades improved and he&nbsp;started getting recruited by&nbsp;every college in&nbsp;the country. “<strong>He&nbsp;became a&nbsp;<a href=#>father figure</a> to&nbsp;me, and a&nbsp;mentor,</strong>” says Johnson.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fb9/7e4/3d613a509c8365758bd6d5a82c.jpg><p>Thanks to&nbsp;a&nbsp;successful high school career, Johnson accepted a&nbsp;scholarship to&nbsp;play football at&nbsp;the University of&nbsp;Miami under Coach Dennis Erickson. However, he&nbsp;wasn’t being played much, and he&nbsp;suffered an&nbsp;injury that took him off the field. That was when his <a href=#>depression</a> started. “I&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;do&nbsp;anything,” he&nbsp;recalls. “I&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;go&nbsp;anywhere. <strong>I&nbsp;was crying constantly. Eventually, you reach a&nbsp;point where you are all cried out.</strong>” Then when it&nbsp;was time for the NFL draft&nbsp;— and he&nbsp;did not get picked.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a81/f44/79012d54029cf9f210783fd074.jpg><p>In&nbsp;1995, after not being drafted to&nbsp;the NFL he&nbsp;was signed to&nbsp;play for the <a href=#>Calgary Stampeders</a> in&nbsp;the Canadian Football League. However, he&nbsp;was quickly relegated to&nbsp;the practice team and then ultimately got cut from the team. Eventually, the same coach who cut him from the team <a href=#>called him</a>, wanting him to&nbsp;come back. That is&nbsp;when Johnson made the decision to&nbsp;not go&nbsp;back to&nbsp;football and to&nbsp;instead join the family wrestling business.</p><p><h2>Turning back to&nbsp;his wrestling roots changed his life.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ceb/51c/f02ab35a0882a373b9983dcedf.png><p>Having fully given up&nbsp;on&nbsp;football, Dwayne went back to&nbsp;working on&nbsp;his body and training with his father. He&nbsp;made his World Wrestling Federation debut in&nbsp;1996 under the name “Rocky Maivia.” Fans didn’t like his “<a href=#>good guy</a>” attitude, because it&nbsp;wasn’t authentic, it&nbsp;wasn’t who he&nbsp;truly was. “I&nbsp;represented everything, at&nbsp;that time, that was wrong with pro wrestling, and the fans turned on&nbsp;me... <strong>They started chanting, ‘Rocky sucks‘ at&nbsp;every arena that&nbsp;I went&nbsp;to,</strong>” he&nbsp;<a href=#>recalls</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5ff/2ed/4a06c55c3fb3e25e46f341d52a.jpg><p>That is&nbsp;when Dwayne decided to&nbsp;go&nbsp;“<a href=#>heel</a>,” and give the people what they wanted&nbsp;— a&nbsp;bad guy, who doesn’t care about what people think. He&nbsp;joined “Nation of&nbsp;Domination” alongside Faarooq, D’<a href=# title=Lo data-link=tag>Lo</a> Brown, and Kama where he&nbsp;embraced that “antagonist” aspect of&nbsp;professional wrestling. And just like that, <a href=#>The Rock</a> was born. Dwayne would then go&nbsp;on&nbsp;to&nbsp;become one of&nbsp;the most successful, famous, and loved WWE wrestlers in&nbsp;the world.</p><p><h2>This newfound fame wasn’t enough, Johnson wanted more.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a07/479/694eb65347ba71277a2648e3a8.jpg><p>Johnson recalls the time when he&nbsp;first got into the world of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a>. “They were welcoming, then it&nbsp;got icy, quickly. The iciness was ’Oh, your career is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;done in&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;years. You’ll make a&nbsp;few movies, I’m sure, and then you’ll be&nbsp;out.’ But that was never my&nbsp;goal, and <strong>it&nbsp;took me&nbsp;about 7&nbsp;to&nbsp;8&nbsp;years to&nbsp;realize that I’m done trying to&nbsp;conform to&nbsp;Hollywood, Hollywood is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;work for&nbsp;me,</strong>” he&nbsp;told <a href=#>TIME</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/94a/e8d/962f9c5579b19a507c41f59ec3.jpg><p><h2>The life of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Hollywood mogul and family-man</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3a8/ed7/bc197c5ffdb12787de8db458ec.jpg><p>Dwayne Johnson has found a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;success despite his very rough childhood, and he’s been an&nbsp;inspiration to&nbsp;many people from all over the world. His mindset is&nbsp;that no&nbsp;matter what you achieve, you can always do&nbsp;better and be&nbsp;better. That is&nbsp;why we&nbsp;constantly see him working out in&nbsp;the gym and improving himself. But there’s also the “family-man” side of&nbsp;him. He&nbsp;loves posting pictures of&nbsp;himself with his daughters and wife to&nbsp;his millions of&nbsp;fans:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/03c/ddd/1d872b55bfbe43e4b70788bdf8.jpg><p>“I’ve learned the power that we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;make other people happy and content in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship. And I&nbsp;have the love of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life, Lauren, who I’ve had for 8&nbsp;years now. <strong>I&nbsp;wake up&nbsp;every day so&nbsp;grateful and so&nbsp;thankful that&nbsp;I have someone like that, someone who&nbsp;I can walk through this world with</strong>...,” <a href=#>Johnson shared</a> on&nbsp;Oprah’s OWN.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a9a/3f4/282ca45f719704702c358545d9.jpg><p>Dwayne also spoke on&nbsp;<a href=#>fatherhood</a>, “<strong>I&nbsp;realized that being a&nbsp;father is&nbsp;the greatest job&nbsp;I have ever had, the greatest job&nbsp;I will ever have</strong>. I&nbsp;always wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;great dad, I&nbsp;always wanted to&nbsp;give Simone things&nbsp;I felt&nbsp;I never got. When I&nbsp;held her when she was born, I&nbsp;held her in&nbsp;these 2&nbsp;hands and&nbsp;I said to&nbsp;her, ’I will always, always, take care of&nbsp;you. For the rest of&nbsp;your life.
