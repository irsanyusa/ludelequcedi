This material also resists catching dust and dirt compared to&nbsp;softer models.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong></p><ul><li><i>So&nbsp;I&nbsp;ordered these and they are great! They put a&nbsp;smile on&nbsp;everyone’s face when&nbsp;I pull them out. The quality is&nbsp;really nice, and it&nbsp;fits well on&nbsp;any finger. They also come with a&nbsp;handy like handle? If&nbsp;that’s what you’d call&nbsp;it, that make it&nbsp;easier if&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;pull your sleeves up&nbsp;and pretend they’re your hands for like a&nbsp;prank.</i><br><i>The material is&nbsp;rubbery which makes it&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit easier to&nbsp;try and pick things&nbsp;up (opposed to&nbsp;like plastic) and it’s just overall super funny and awesome! I&nbsp;would definitely gift these to&nbsp;someone!</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@Madeline M</a></li></ul><h2>2. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Pickle bottle stopper</a> that helps preserve your wine perfectly. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;designed with flexible silicone to&nbsp;easily fit most wine bottles. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;3.5’’ tall and can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;great conversation starter at&nbsp;your home gatherings.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ea6/c62/3576a353729284dce8657b38fb.jpg><p>The wine stopper is&nbsp;made from 100% <a href=# title=food data-link=tag>food</a> grade silicone and should be&nbsp;washed by&nbsp;hand.

People love it&nbsp;when&nbsp;I use it&nbsp;and it’s always a&nbsp;hit. Downside is&nbsp;it’s hard to&nbsp;fit it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the fridge door, so&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;readjust the 2nd shelf a&nbsp;little higher. It’s a&nbsp;soft rubber/silicone material, and you just tuck the white part in&nbsp;the wine and stand back and giggle.</i><br><i>I’ve had it&nbsp;a&nbsp;good while now and use it&nbsp;all the time. I’m a&nbsp;wine freak and a&nbsp;gadget freak, so&nbsp;anything that makes that activity more entertaining or&nbsp;efficient gets my&nbsp;vote.</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@Canon</a></li></ul><h2>3. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Cat hand towels</a> that come in&nbsp;a&nbsp;variety of&nbsp;colors. The snap button of&nbsp;the cat’s hands prevents the towel from slipping off. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;suitable for wiping your hands and face. When you wipe your hands from the cat’s belly, you will be&nbsp;amazed by&nbsp;the soft fabric.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dba/377/b0cfcb5860a77ba6945148c256.jpg><p>The towels are&nbsp;85% polyester&nbsp;15% nylon. The soft and comfortable fabric has strong water absorption. They not only dry your water droplets, but also add some fun to&nbsp;your bathroom or&nbsp;<a href=# title=kitchen data-link=tag>kitchen</a>.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong></p><ul><li><i>This towel is&nbsp;really cute. The cat is&nbsp;pretty realistic looking for being a&nbsp;towel. It’s too cute for using like you would a&nbsp;regular old hand towel, and it&nbsp;isn’t the most absorbent. But it’s worthwhile if&nbsp;you like cats and want something to&nbsp;cheer up&nbsp;your sink area.</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@MeM Kemper</a></li></ul><h2>4. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Mini cloud box cutters</a> in&nbsp;6&nbsp;different colors, including orange, purple, green, blue, white, and pink. The blade of&nbsp;the mini cutter is&nbsp;retractable.

Their size is&nbsp;2.2×1.4 inches and the thickness of&nbsp;the retractable blade is&nbsp;0.017&nbsp;inches. You can just carry it&nbsp;into your pocket.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong></p><ul><li><i>I&nbsp;love these little things. My&nbsp;teenager has even stolen a&nbsp;few. I&nbsp;glued magnets to&nbsp;the back of&nbsp;a&nbsp;few and put on&nbsp;the refrigerator and on&nbsp;the back of&nbsp;the metal front door. These things can cut open my&nbsp;Amazon boxes easily without much fuss.</i><br><i>My&nbsp;teen used it&nbsp;to&nbsp;cut apart the boxes for an&nbsp;art project, so&nbsp;they even stand up&nbsp;to&nbsp;regular use. I&nbsp;may have to&nbsp;buy another set, so&nbsp;I can keep some from my&nbsp;teen this time. Even thinking of&nbsp;carrying a&nbsp;few in&nbsp;the car.</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@Amy H</a></li></ul><h2>5. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Bus-shaped egg holder</a> that can fit 12&nbsp;eggs. This whimsical tray keeps your eggs fresh and fun. It’s hygienic and super sturdy. When it’s time to&nbsp;clean&nbsp;up, simply pop it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the dishwasher. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;food-safe and made from BPA-free materials.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/495/85e/b47d0353128d688acfa9d6d00b.png><p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;sturdy enough to&nbsp;even stack multiple buses on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;one another. It&nbsp;makes up&nbsp;for the perfect quirky gift from anyone who loves kitchen-related presents.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong></p><ul><li><i>The main reason&nbsp;I got this bus was due to&nbsp;its really cool design</i>,<i> but also because my&nbsp;young son loves “wheels on&nbsp;the bus” nursery rhyme. Sure enough, he&nbsp;saw it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the fridge and started singing the song. I&nbsp;highly recommend&nbsp;it. All the eggs fit perfectly.</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@MJ</a></li></ul><h2>6. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Cherry-shaped toilet brush</a> that is&nbsp;durable and has soft and thick bristles, which can remove stains forcefully. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;rust resistant, with non-porous base design, making it&nbsp;great for storage. The long, curved handle prevents dirty water from splashing on&nbsp;your body.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ec1/690/abaa11522ea5e1822387b73715.jpg><p>The toilet brush is&nbsp;space-saving and can be&nbsp;hung on&nbsp;the wall if&nbsp;not in&nbsp;use. It&nbsp;helps reduce kneeling and bending, since it&nbsp;is&nbsp;easy to&nbsp;grab and use. It&nbsp;won’t flip or&nbsp;tip over, and allow water to&nbsp;drain.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong></p><ul><li><i>Adds a&nbsp;cute touch of&nbsp;class to&nbsp;the bathroom! You don’t have to&nbsp;worry about guests judging you for your dirty toilet brush any longer! They will never know!</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@Amazon Customer</a></li></ul><h2>7. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Red lips holder</a> where you can store your makeup and jewelry. This organizer is&nbsp;super easy to&nbsp;clean; just wipe it&nbsp;with a&nbsp;damp cloth or&nbsp;rinse it&nbsp;underwater directly. Its compact size makes it&nbsp;ideal for any space, no&nbsp;matter how small.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d92/b4c/3358c95e58b9b80621139eb3db.png><p>You can place this item anywhere in&nbsp;your house, including the living room, the dresser, and even your bathroom. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;also great for placing on&nbsp;a&nbsp;retail shop’s counter as&nbsp;decoration.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong></p><ul><li><i>The make of&nbsp;the ceramic lips is&nbsp;just what I&nbsp;wanted. But I&nbsp;thought it&nbsp;would have been more of&nbsp;a&nbsp;shiny ruby/fire engine red. So&nbsp;I&nbsp;painted the top lip with red nail polish.</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@Shoeaholic</a></li></ul><h2>8. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Crazy soda flavors</a> that come in&nbsp;a&nbsp;pack of&nbsp;6, including Buffalo wing, bacon, ranch dressing, peanut butter and jelly, sweet corn, and pumpkin pie. They all have a&nbsp;low caffeine content, making it&nbsp;a&nbsp;great option for adults.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/197/506/219ca952d4a4f494b216cf17a1.png><p>These soda pop bottles are made for adults and have a&nbsp;refreshing cucumber flavor that will cool you down on&nbsp;a&nbsp;hot day. Plus, the 12-ounce bottles with their fun labels will make them stand out on&nbsp;the shelf.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong></p><ul><li><i>These are unique flavors</i>,<i> to&nbsp;say the least. If&nbsp;you are thinking you are going to&nbsp;sit down and drink the whole bottle, not happening. We&nbsp;used them for “punishments” when someone lost at&nbsp;family game night. It&nbsp;was awesome and hilarious. If&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;cheat&nbsp;I can tell you ranch is&nbsp;the worst so&nbsp;make sure if&nbsp;you lose you don’t pick that one to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;shot&nbsp;of.</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@Britt</a></li></ul><h2>9. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Bicycle hamburger bell</a> that will definitely attract all eyes on&nbsp;you and your bike. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;constructed with internal steel dome and molded composite exterior. It&nbsp;measures 22.2&nbsp;mm in&nbsp;length and 65&nbsp;mm in&nbsp;diameter.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e5c/bdf/a9e18c557aab687a379670269c.jpg><p>This hamburger bell filled with lettuce, pickles, sauce, and onions will be&nbsp;so&nbsp;popular that you may need to&nbsp;remove it&nbsp;at&nbsp;night so&nbsp;no&nbsp;one will steal&nbsp;it.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong></p><ul><li><i>If&nbsp;I&nbsp;remember correctly</i>,<i> I&nbsp;gifted this three years ago on&nbsp;Christmas to&nbsp;my&nbsp;little brother. We&nbsp;have a&nbsp;very busy household, kids in&nbsp;and out, and this ringer has survived the test of&nbsp;time. Still works like it’s new. The fading has begun, but it&nbsp;still looks like a&nbsp;hamburger! And it’s to&nbsp;be&nbsp;expected, as&nbsp;with anything that is&nbsp;often left out in&nbsp;the weather and used a&nbsp;lot.</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@Anne Marie</a></li></ul><h2>10. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Creative hooks</a>, where you can hang your coats, scarves, umbrellas, toys, cups, and other kitchen utensils.

They can be&nbsp;used on&nbsp;a&nbsp;variety of&nbsp;smooth surfaces such as&nbsp;wood, tile, ceramic, metal, and plastic. Not suitable for wallpaper, painted walls or&nbsp;other rough surfaces.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong></p><ul><li><i>I&nbsp;got these to&nbsp;hold my&nbsp;motorcycle bags, and the heaviest one&nbsp;I have is&nbsp;my&nbsp;turtle shell looking one. I&nbsp;also must say that the thing is&nbsp;nothing short from being super lightweight. I’ve had these things hanging on&nbsp;my&nbsp;wall since&nbsp;I got these bad boys, and&nbsp;I can definitely say they be&nbsp;sticking. I&nbsp;didn’t want something cheesy just sitting on&nbsp;my&nbsp;wall giving me&nbsp;the death glare, so&nbsp;these definitely worked out better than I&nbsp;expected.</i><br><i>Not only are they super cute, but they can hold about anything you could think&nbsp;of. They have been going strong, and&nbsp;I expect them to&nbsp;continue to&nbsp;go&nbsp;strong, which they should, I&nbsp;would be&nbsp;disappointed if&nbsp;they didn’t. On&nbsp;that note, I&nbsp;don’t remember exactly, but&nbsp;I could’ve sworn there was a&nbsp;thing to&nbsp;hang it&nbsp;up&nbsp;by&nbsp;a&nbsp;screw if&nbsp;you really wanted&nbsp;to. </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@emi</a></li></ul><h2>11. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Mushroom fridge deodorizer</a> that absorbs odors in&nbsp;its belly. Before using for the first time, wash the little mushroom. Take the lid off and pour in&nbsp;baking soda.

I’m someone who always loves useful yet aesthetically pleasing additions to&nbsp;anything. Seeing my&nbsp;personality shine through the items&nbsp;I own is&nbsp;something&nbsp;I take pride&nbsp;in. This little guy proves to&nbsp;do&nbsp;an&nbsp;amazing job keeping all the scents in&nbsp;my&nbsp;fridge at&nbsp;a&nbsp;minimum.</i><br><i>He’s small and can fit in&nbsp;anywhere. It’s easy to&nbsp;knock him over, so&nbsp;keep an&nbsp;eye out for that, but overall an&nbsp;amazing addition to&nbsp;my&nbsp;fridge. Also keep track of&nbsp;when to&nbsp;swap out the <a href=# title="baking soda" data-link=tag>baking soda</a>, the efficiency of&nbsp;its odor removal can depend on&nbsp;how much you add and how long it’s been there.</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@Lesley</a></li></ul><h2>12. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Bacon bandages</a> that don’t only look appetizing, but also are very adhesive.

Be&nbsp;the life of&nbsp;the party when you show up&nbsp;at&nbsp;church with a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;these on&nbsp;your face.

The facial expressions are moving, and the natural scenes are breathtaking. The cover photo is&nbsp;tasteful in&nbsp;not displaying any fecal matter. The cover title and font is&nbsp;well selected for alliteration and a&nbsp;subtle but attention grabbing message.</i><br><i>My&nbsp;favorite photo is&nbsp;of&nbsp;Charlie, who is&nbsp;delighted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;lightening his load while wearing a&nbsp;spirited costume for fun.
