And the main character there was a&nbsp;starving young girl who tried to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;through a&nbsp;survival game. So&nbsp;the film executives wanted Lawrence to&nbsp;slim down enough to&nbsp;match this image.</p><p>Such a&nbsp;huge role was a&nbsp;great responsibility for the actress. And yet, the biggest conversation back then was not about acting itself or&nbsp;any other issues concerning the shooting. The biggest one, says the actress, was “How much <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>weight</a> are you going to&nbsp;lose?”</p><p><h2>She knew that her character may “inspire” many young fans to&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;their weight too much.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b74/5c9/b06b505d49b39d186f044c50b1.jpg><p>Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP/East News<span>, </span>John Shearer/Invision/AP/East News</p><p>But despite the pressure, Lawrence understood that those books were very popular, and the audience was primarily children. So&nbsp;she stayed firm in&nbsp;her choice not to&nbsp;diet for the role, both because she cared about herself and her young fans.</p><p>In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Variety</i></a>,<i> </i>she said: “Along with me&nbsp;being young and growing and not able to&nbsp;be&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;diet, I&nbsp;don’t know if&nbsp;I want all of&nbsp;the girls who are going to&nbsp;dress up&nbsp;as&nbsp;Katniss to&nbsp;feel like they can’t because they’re not a&nbsp;certain weight. And I&nbsp;can’t let that seep into my&nbsp;brain either.”</p><p><h2>After shooting the movies, Lawrence started to&nbsp;speak out openly against dieting.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ad2/32b/77368356118eda818c4999fe1e.jpg><p>Joel C Ryan/Invision/AP/East News</p><p>The actress remembers that before <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Hunger Games</i></a><i>,</i> nobody ever put a&nbsp;woman in&nbsp;the lead of&nbsp;an&nbsp;action movie because they thought it&nbsp;wouldn’t work. It&nbsp;was believed that girls and boys were more prone to&nbsp;identify themselves with a&nbsp;male rather than a&nbsp;female lead. Nevertheless, Lawrence still didn’t want to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;risk.</p><p>She says that she’s never going to&nbsp;starve herself for a&nbsp;part, and speaks openly about being against any <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dieting</a>. “I&nbsp;don’t diet. I&nbsp;do exercise! But I&nbsp;don’t diet. You can’t work when you’re hungry, you know?” she said.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;wasn’t the first time the actress refused to&nbsp;lose weight for a&nbsp;role.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/be9/2e4/03a076553eb961d068ab700018.jpg><p>Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP/East News</p><p>Her attitude toward dieting is&nbsp;mainly because of&nbsp;her unpleasant experience while playing a&nbsp;former ballerina in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Red Sparrow</i></a>. And it&nbsp;was the first time she was really hungry. She tried hard to&nbsp;get into character by&nbsp;matching the ballerina’s diet, but eventually couldn’t stick to&nbsp;it.</p><p>All in&nbsp;all, it&nbsp;turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;real struggle to&nbsp;work hungry and often ended up&nbsp;in&nbsp;“freaking out,” for instance, after eating just 5&nbsp;banana chips. No&nbsp;wonder she refused to&nbsp;lose <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>15&nbsp;pounds</a> in&nbsp;2&nbsp;weeks for a&nbsp;role prior to&nbsp;<i>Hunger Games</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/705/b92/04583e5017bdb58fd41f17ffd9.jpg><p>Some other actors have quite a&nbsp;different approach when losing or&nbsp;gaining whatever weight is&nbsp;necessary for a&nbsp;single role.
