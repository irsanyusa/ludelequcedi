The episode ended on a cliffhanger, as we won’t find out who Kate Kalvach chose as her coach until the show returns on Tuesday night.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-voice-season-22-premieres-with-four-chair-turns>‘The Voice’ Season 22 Premieres with Four-Chair Turns</h2><p>The episode kicked off with a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">performance from Morgan Myles</a>, whose audition was released ahead of the episode. She sang a country-tinged version of “Hallelujah,” turning all four coaches’ chairs and inspiring Cabello to block Gwen Stefani.</p><p>We were left the wonder who Myles chose as her coach, and in Monday’s episode we learned that she chose to join Cabello’s team, so that block paid off. Cabello gifted her with a fanny pack to welcome her to the team.</p><p>The show immediately moved on to yet another four-chair turn after that, as Omar Cardona wowed the coaches with his cover of “Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)” by Journey. John Legend predicted that Omar could win the show, and the singer ultimately chose to join Legend’s team.</p><p>Later on, a singer named Orlando Mendez (nicknamed the “Cuban cowboy”) sang “Beer Never Broke My Heart” by Luke Combs, turning all four coaches’ chairs. It was a battle mostly between Cabello and Blake Shelton. Orlando is from Miami, where Cabello grew up, but he shares a genre with Shelton. Ultimately, he chose to join Team Camila.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HERE’S WHAT TO EXPECT ON ‘THE VOICE’ SEASON 22</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-shelton-losing-his-crown>Is Shelton Losing His Crown?</h3><p>Interestingly, longtime coach Blake Shelton didn’t earn any artists for his team on Monday night (although one artist’s choice is still up in the air), even among the country stars. At one point, after losing country singer Jay Allen to his wife Stefani, he said he no longer seems to be the “country king.”</p><p>It might not help that Shelton has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">clearly gotten cocky</a> after appearing on 22 seasons and winning eight. After Morgan Myles’ audition, he hit a button that put his fellow coaches in the dark, and he later muted Cabello’s mic while she was trying to talk to Kate Kalvach. To top it all off, he brought out an actual goat at one point, implying that he is the “Greatest of All Time.”</p><p>Kalvach performed “Rainbow” by Kacey Musgraves, inspiring Shelton, Cabello, and Stefani to turn their chairs for her. The artist herself admitted that Shelton was her first choice, but she said he “didn’t even fight for me.” In response, he pointed to their shared home state of Oklahoma when trying to convince her to join his team.</p><p>Will it work? We’ll find out when the show returns Tuesday night at 8/7c on NBC.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Original_AdamLevine_Shlomi-PintoGetty-Images.jpg alt="Adam Levine Denies Alleged Affair with Instagram Model Sumner Stroh" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZq6fnrCmedGempqoXaiyor%2FOp2Rral2lv6a5yJ6pnqtdrLa1tIymrKWsmaW5pnnFqKyrZZOdrqq%2BjK2sq6ajZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
