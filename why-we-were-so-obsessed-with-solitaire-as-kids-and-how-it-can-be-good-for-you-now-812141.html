The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>study</a>&nbsp;— which involved 2,217&nbsp;children, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>largest</a> group of&nbsp;kids in&nbsp;research of&nbsp;this kind&nbsp;— found that playing video games might improve children’s cognitive skills and help with their impulse control.</p><p>The results were achieved by&nbsp;seeing how well kids who play 3&nbsp;hours or&nbsp;more a&nbsp;day performed in&nbsp;a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;tasks compared to&nbsp;those who don’t play video games at&nbsp;all. The tasks focused on&nbsp;memory and impulse control, and the author of&nbsp;the study, Bader Chaarani, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confirmed</a> that the young gamers did better on&nbsp;the tests and “have more brain activations in&nbsp;regions linked with attention and working memory.”</p><p><h2>For adults, being a&nbsp;gamer can have emotional benefits.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c95/06b/dca7c6501b9fe15167110501eb.jpg><p>When it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;grown-ups, gaming seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;beneficial as&nbsp;well. Actually, video games of&nbsp;certain genres might help improve the psychological state of&nbsp;adults, says <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>research</a>. Out of&nbsp;the 2,107 people who were surveyed, 88.4% of&nbsp;them thought that gaming improved their emotional well-being in&nbsp;some way.</p><p>In&nbsp;fact, various research shares the same sort of&nbsp;findings, with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>one</a> study stating that commercial video games played for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>entertainment</a> have a&nbsp;similar positive impact on&nbsp;mental health as&nbsp;games that are specifically designed for therapy.</p><p>And that’s not all.</p><p><h2>Gaming also positively affects seniors.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dcd/3af/649cb65e21bd528fd7fec2cc98.jpg><p>The idea that digital gaming is&nbsp;exclusively for the young is&nbsp;long gone. Between 2016 and 2019, the number of&nbsp;people age 50&nbsp;and over who play video games grew from 40.2 million to&nbsp;50.6&nbsp;million, according to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>survey</a>. And they too can reap the benefits of&nbsp;being gamers, even if&nbsp;they only turn to&nbsp;it&nbsp;occasionally.</p><p>Different research has shown that there’s a&nbsp;positive impact on&nbsp;those who are older and play video games. One <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>study</a> in&nbsp;particular, which gathered 140 seniors between the ages of&nbsp;63&nbsp;and 92&nbsp;years old, claims that the positive impact of&nbsp;playing happens for both regular and casual gamers. And it&nbsp;specifically found that they have greater emotional well-being and social functioning, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;reduced levels of&nbsp;<a href=# title=depression data-link=tag>depression</a>, than those who never play.</p><p>So, all in&nbsp;all, it&nbsp;seems like the good old days of&nbsp;sitting awhile at&nbsp;the computer playing <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Solitaire</a> should make a&nbsp;return!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/413/b0a/c136205b81bf127a33f1532b06.jpg><p>Even for fans of&nbsp;the American series, <i>The Office</i>, there’s one fascinating detail they might have missed. The characters of&nbsp;the show, especially Creed, could often be&nbsp;found playing Solitaire in&nbsp;the background throughout different scenes.</p><p>In&nbsp;fact, the actor who portrayed Creed, who shares his name with his character, said the computers on&nbsp;set were completely functional and people would often take care of&nbsp;personal matters during shooting. When they were on&nbsp;camera, they simply switched to&nbsp;the game in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;keep their matters private. “You pretty much got used to&nbsp;playing Spider Solitaire,” Creed revealed in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>, where he&nbsp;jokingly added that he&nbsp;had played “a&nbsp;thousand or&nbsp;so” games by&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the show. “I&nbsp;got really good at&nbsp;that game,” he&nbsp;said.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> gets commissions for game plays made through the links in&nbsp;this post.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYywnGavlaeybr%2FOZqabq5WowKawjLCgraBdqLyttdOaoKudXZbAbrfInapmmZ6Zeqm71magrWWTlrtursRmnqinlGKzsL6MsqauZZ6kxG6EkGtobWlf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
