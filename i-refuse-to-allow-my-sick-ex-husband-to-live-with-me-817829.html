We&nbsp;separated 4&nbsp;years ago after he&nbsp;said he&nbsp;was tired of&nbsp;seeing my&nbsp;old face every day and wanted to&nbsp;find someone younger (his words to&nbsp;my&nbsp;face when asking for <a href=# title=divorce data-link=tag>divorce</a>). The divorce was a&nbsp;mess, he&nbsp;tried in&nbsp;every way to&nbsp;take everything I&nbsp;had, and&nbsp;I even had to&nbsp;take on&nbsp;half of&nbsp;his debts. Long story short, I&nbsp;never talked to&nbsp;him again face to&nbsp;face, and we&nbsp;only talk through lawyers when it’s something about our children.</p><p>Months ago, from my&nbsp;children, I&nbsp;found out that he&nbsp;was diagnosed with <a href=# title=cancer data-link=tag>cancer</a>, and it&nbsp;is&nbsp;in&nbsp;an&nbsp;advanced stage. I&nbsp;didn’t say anything more about&nbsp;it, because any topic related to&nbsp;him doesn’t appeal to&nbsp;me, but&nbsp;I decided to&nbsp;support my&nbsp;children and stay by&nbsp;their side.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/517/967/46342d550bad633546248ab9f1.jpg><p>Yesterday, my&nbsp;3&nbsp;children (all live with&nbsp;me) sat down with me&nbsp;telling me&nbsp;that their father could no&nbsp;longer work (chemo + cancer) and wouldn’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;his current <a href=# title=home data-link=tag>home</a>, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;had nowhere to&nbsp;live, and they would like for him to&nbsp;live here in&nbsp;these last stages.</p><p>I&nbsp;immediately said no&nbsp;and that&nbsp;I felt offended that&nbsp;I had even been asked that question, knowing how much he&nbsp;and&nbsp;I dislike each other.</p><p>They started to&nbsp;argue, saying that our house was his last option, because his relatives couldn’t, and they didn’t want to&nbsp;leave their father without a&nbsp;home and that&nbsp;I should think about them.</p><p>I&nbsp;asked who would take care of&nbsp;him when things got worse, because all three of&nbsp;them work outside the home and&nbsp;I work from home, or&nbsp;who would cover all of&nbsp;his financial and medical expenses. They didn’t know how to&nbsp;answer and that they would decide between the 3&nbsp;of&nbsp;them to&nbsp;help their father and not be&nbsp;so&nbsp;burdensome for me&nbsp;and that the 3&nbsp;of&nbsp;them were willing to&nbsp;let their father live in&nbsp;our house.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/55d/3ac/5fbc285d859fc67531ce0dd57a.jpg><p>I&nbsp;said that despite valuing their opinion on&nbsp;any other matter in&nbsp;the house, this matter is&nbsp;my&nbsp;decision alone, and it&nbsp;remains&nbsp;no.</p><p>They called me&nbsp;heartless and said that they are just trying to&nbsp;give their father a&nbsp;place to&nbsp;live, not my&nbsp;ex-husband. And I&nbsp;was being petty about all the things he&nbsp;did and not thinking about them.</p><p>They’re still pressuring me&nbsp;to&nbsp;change my&nbsp;mind, especially with their father only having 15&nbsp;more days in&nbsp;his house, but&nbsp;I can’t feel anything other than offended that they asked that, knowing how much the divorce messed with&nbsp;me (depression and anxiety).</p><p>My&nbsp;ex&nbsp;got in&nbsp;touch on&nbsp;my&nbsp;personal number, asking to&nbsp;rethink and leave the past behind just in&nbsp;these last moments. Funny that he&nbsp;asked&nbsp;me, but not his exes much younger than&nbsp;me.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d72/f7d/a42359570ea4b29f26211c16be.jpg><p><h2>Netizens agreed with the poster.</h2></p><ul><li>«Tell him he&nbsp;can ask his much younger and „cuter“ exes. After all, you wouldn’t want to&nbsp;bother him with your „old face“ every day. And do&nbsp;your kids know how he&nbsp;treated you? I&nbsp;understand not getting involved with my&nbsp;parent’s grievances, but as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child in&nbsp;that situation, I&nbsp;would <i>never</i> consider even asking my&nbsp;mother to&nbsp;care for my&nbsp;father if&nbsp;I knew how he&nbsp;treated her.» <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Reyvakitten&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>«At&nbsp;22–25 years old, they’re old enough to&nbsp;realize it’s an&nbsp;unreasonable ask of&nbsp;their mother and to&nbsp;make their own sacrifices to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;him if&nbsp;they want&nbsp;to. Not to&nbsp;expect mommy to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;for them. People live on&nbsp;their own at&nbsp;that age.<br>It’s kind and caring that&nbsp;OP is&nbsp;letting them live at&nbsp;home until they’re ready to&nbsp;be&nbsp;off on&nbsp;their own. They should appreciate that. OP’s not stopping them from helping their father or&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;discourage them from doing&nbsp;so. She just understandably doesn’t want it&nbsp;done in&nbsp;her home, on&nbsp;her time and on&nbsp;her dime.» <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>exscapegoat&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>«I’d normally say you should never spill all of&nbsp;the nasty divorce details to&nbsp;your kids since it&nbsp;could change the way they see you or&nbsp;their other parent. This situation is&nbsp;entirely different, in&nbsp;part because the kids are adults and also because&nbsp;OP has multiple extremely valid reasons for refusing to&nbsp;let him move&nbsp;in.<br>If&nbsp;her 3&nbsp;kids that are in&nbsp;their 20s can’t even afford to&nbsp;live alone, there is&nbsp;zero chance that all of&nbsp;the financial and <a href=# title=emotional data-link=tag>emotional</a> burden for supporting the ex/father won’t fall almost entirely on&nbsp;OP’s shoulders. It&nbsp;sucks that he&nbsp;has cancer, but he&nbsp;also has to&nbsp;lie in&nbsp;the bed he&nbsp;made for himself.» <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>CreditUpstairs7621&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>«If&nbsp;he&nbsp;hadn’t insulted her, abandoned her, probably cheated on&nbsp;her, divorced her and tried to&nbsp;leave her destitute while successfully leaving her with half his debts, then they would have still been married when he&nbsp;got his cancer diagnosis, and she might have been perfectly willing to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;him and pay his medical bills (assuming he&nbsp;treated her with <a href=# title=respect data-link=tag>respect</a> if&nbsp;not love).<br>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;entirely his fault that he&nbsp;doesn’t have a&nbsp;home to&nbsp;live in&nbsp;or&nbsp;a&nbsp;wife to&nbsp;care for him, he&nbsp;threw that away to&nbsp;date what sounds like a&nbsp;string of&nbsp;gold diggers, and now that he&nbsp;has nothing they want nothing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with his cancer-riddled, middle-aged butt. OP&nbsp;should not be&nbsp;expected to&nbsp;just suck it&nbsp;up, take on&nbsp;more of&nbsp;his debt, and shoulder the burden of&nbsp;caring for this selfish, spiteful man.» <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>GovernorSan&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e6c/665/5dd21150d4813053c7517dfbf6.jpg><ul><li>«The kids definitely don’t get&nbsp;it. They’re talking about bringing dad in&nbsp;like a&nbsp;stray dog. „Someone“ will feed and walk the dog and pay for his expenses.

You are not a&nbsp;rehabilitation center or&nbsp;a&nbsp;forgetful sanctuary just because he&nbsp;now faces his mortality. You shared a&nbsp;life once, but that bond was severed through his own doing. Being in&nbsp;need does not automatically qualify him for your <a href=# title=compassion data-link=tag>compassion</a> or&nbsp;your home, especially not at&nbsp;the expense of&nbsp;your peace of&nbsp;mind.<br>I&nbsp;understand your children’s position stems from emotional turmoil, but their perspective is&nbsp;evidently blinded by&nbsp;the situation. They should rather focus on&nbsp;providing support in&nbsp;ways that do&nbsp;not involve sacrificing your comfort. Maybe they could arrange a&nbsp;caretaking service or&nbsp;look into palliative care facilities. Your well-being also matters, and you have the right to&nbsp;set boundaries to&nbsp;protect&nbsp;it. It’s not just about „leaving the past behind,“ it’s about not allowing someone who caused you distress to&nbsp;disrupt your life once again.» <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Ok_Strategy_5392&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p>Having to&nbsp;deal with exes that have broken our hearts before is&nbsp;never easy.
