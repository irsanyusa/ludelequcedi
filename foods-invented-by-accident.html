Working at Moon's Lake House in Saratoga Springs, New York, Crum became frustrated with a customer who repeatedly sent back his fried potatoes, claiming they were not crispy enough. In response, Crum sliced the potatoes as thin as possible, fried them to a crisp, and added extra salt. To his surprise, the customer loved them, and <a href=# id=dfa31208-5088-4edd-a199-82dfb6389a6e>potato chips were born</a>.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-10>3.

The Kelloggs were attempting to make a healthy, vegetarian food by toasting wheat berries. They accidentally left a batch of cooked wheat sitting out and discovered that it had gone stale. Rather than throwing it away, they decided to bake it, creating crispy flakes. They later experimented with corn, leading to <a href=# id=93a47b2a-62ed-4bdf-821f-746aedd770e8>the creation of cornflakes</a>​.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-13>4.

A Syrian immigrant named <strong>Ernest Hamwi</strong> was selling thin, crispy pastries called zalabia next to an ice cream vendor. When the vendor ran out of dishes to serve ice cream, Hamwi rolled one of his pastries into a cone shape to hold the ice cream. This improvisation was a hit with fairgoers and led to the widespread adoption of the ice cream cone.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-16>5.

According to legend, yoghurt was first created thousands of years ago by nomadic tribes in Central Asia. These tribes would carry milk in animal skins or pouches while travelling. The hot weather and bumpy rides would cause the milk to ferment naturally, creating <a href=# id=c007400d-392a-42fa-a0e7-5bf2df8323fc>a thick and tangy yoghurt-like drink</a>. While the story might be a bit fuzzy, it's clear that yoghurt was a happy accident that turned into something delicious.</p><p>These delicious foods remind us that sometimes, mistakes can end up being wonderful discoveries.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>This content was created with the help of an AI model and verified by the writer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8OsZKKmppq7tbHDZpmyZZGYsKqwxKeraKRhor23vNU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
