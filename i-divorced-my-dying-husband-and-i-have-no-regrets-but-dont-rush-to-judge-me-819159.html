We&nbsp;visited over 40&nbsp;countries, <a href=# title=engaged data-link=tag>engaged</a> in&nbsp;extreme sports, and built successful careers. Everything changed when my&nbsp;husband was diagnosed with cancer. I&nbsp;was in&nbsp;such shock that it&nbsp;felt like my&nbsp;world had literally collapsed.”</p><p>“It&nbsp;took me&nbsp;several months to&nbsp;come to&nbsp;terms with the <a href=# title=diagnosis data-link=tag>diagnosis</a> and adjust to&nbsp;our new way of&nbsp;life. However, I&nbsp;eventually pulled myself together and made a&nbsp;firm decision that we&nbsp;would face this challenge together.”</p><p><h2>The woman took charge of&nbsp;everything, from managing the household to&nbsp;overseeing her husband’s treatment.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fac/2ad/88025f55e4ae99c31c6542bab3.jpg><p>“I&nbsp;quit my&nbsp;job and took on&nbsp;the full responsibility of&nbsp;managing our household and my&nbsp;husband’s treatment. I&nbsp;coordinated his doctor visits and diligently searched for new doctors and alternative treatment options. I&nbsp;handled everything from scheduling appointments and managing medications to&nbsp;keeping track of&nbsp;medical records and exploring cutting-edge therapies. My&nbsp;days were consumed with ensuring he&nbsp;received the best possible care while also maintaining some semblance of&nbsp;normalcy at&nbsp;home.”</p><p><h2>Her husband wallowed into self-pity.</h2></p><p>“My&nbsp;life became a&nbsp;living hell with a&nbsp;relentless cycle of&nbsp;constant doctor visits and grim prognoses. I&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;stay positive, doing my&nbsp;best to&nbsp;keep our spirits&nbsp;up, while my&nbsp;husband wallowed into self-pity. The last straw was when he&nbsp;refused to&nbsp;undergo chemotherapy, claiming it&nbsp;was too painful and wouldn’t guarantee him a&nbsp;cure.<br>It&nbsp;seemed as&nbsp;though he&nbsp;had stopped seeing me&nbsp;altogether. All he&nbsp;could focus on&nbsp;was his own pain and suffering. He&nbsp;didn’t notice the efforts&nbsp;I was making or&nbsp;acknowledge the fact that&nbsp;I, too, was struggling and hurting. I&nbsp;sacrificed everything to&nbsp;support him through this journey, so&nbsp;his decision felt like a&nbsp;betrayal.”</p><p>“I&nbsp;begged and pleaded with him, trying to&nbsp;convince him that it&nbsp;was his best chance at&nbsp;survival. But he&nbsp;remained adamant, choosing instead to&nbsp;pursue alternative treatments that offered little scientific evidence of&nbsp;effectiveness.<br>As&nbsp;his condition deteriorated, so&nbsp;did our relationship. Resentment built up&nbsp;inside me&nbsp;as&nbsp;I watched him surrender to&nbsp;his illness without putting up&nbsp;a&nbsp;fight. I&nbsp;felt betrayed and abandoned, left to&nbsp;carry the burden of&nbsp;his sickness alone.”</p><p><h2>She made a&nbsp;decision to&nbsp;leave her husband.</h2></p><p>“Despite my&nbsp;frustration and anger, I&nbsp;couldn’t bring myself to&nbsp;leave him. I&nbsp;made a&nbsp;vow to&nbsp;stand by&nbsp;him in&nbsp;sickness and in&nbsp;health, and&nbsp;I intended to&nbsp;honor&nbsp;it. But as&nbsp;the days turned into weeks and the weeks turned into months, I&nbsp;found myself questioning everything.”</p><p>“One fateful night, as&nbsp;I sat by&nbsp;his bedside, watching him sleep fitfully, I&nbsp;reached my&nbsp;breaking point. The exhaustion of&nbsp;being his caretaker, the weight of&nbsp;his illness pressing down on&nbsp;me—it was all too much to&nbsp;bear. I&nbsp;knew then that&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;choice for myself, for my&nbsp;own sanity and well-being. This night&nbsp;I made the most difficult decision of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life.”</p><p><h2>Her decision left a&nbsp;deep scar in&nbsp;her soul.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/336/ad6/2b82ca5911aea750be066c48f1.jpg><p>“This decision left a&nbsp;profound scar on&nbsp;my&nbsp;soul. It&nbsp;triggered a&nbsp;negative reaction from our mutual friends and relatives. Many simply failed to&nbsp;understand me&nbsp;and believed&nbsp;I had betrayed my&nbsp;husband.<br>It&nbsp;took several years of&nbsp;therapy for me&nbsp;to&nbsp;realize that I&nbsp;am not a&nbsp;bad person, that&nbsp;I prioritized myself in&nbsp;this situation. My&nbsp;husband made his decision, and&nbsp;I made mine.”</p><p>“I&nbsp;hope that my&nbsp;story will help those who find themselves in&nbsp;a&nbsp;similar situation. It’s crucial to&nbsp;seek help from a&nbsp;psychologist, both for the patients themselves and for their family members. Maybe our story would have ended differently if&nbsp;we&nbsp;had just visited a&nbsp;couple’s therapist.”</p><h2><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>BONUS</u></a>: Psychological tips for caregivers of&nbsp;cancer patients</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8af/ae7/abe6015c08b7916a1427a1cef7.jpg><ul><li><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Ask</strong></a><strong> for help. </strong>Many caregivers say that, looking back, they took too much on&nbsp;themselves. Or&nbsp;they wish they had asked for help from friends or&nbsp;family sooner. Take an&nbsp;honest look at&nbsp;what you can and can’t do. What things do&nbsp;you need or&nbsp;want to&nbsp;do&nbsp;yourself? What tasks can you turn over or&nbsp;share with people?</li><li><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Take care</strong></a><strong> of&nbsp;yourself.</strong> All family caregivers need support. But you may feel that your needs aren’t important right now, since you’re not the cancer patient. You may be&nbsp;so&nbsp;used to&nbsp;taking care of&nbsp;someone else that it’s hard for you to&nbsp;change focus. But caring for your own needs, hopes, and desires can give you the strength you need to&nbsp;carry&nbsp;on.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5b3/096/a7f6135fab8385f3e6e7833b1e.jpg><ul><li><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Understand</strong></a><strong> your feelings.</strong> Giving yourself an&nbsp;outlet for your own thoughts and feelings is&nbsp;important. Think about what would help lift your spirits. Would talking with others help ease your load? Or&nbsp;would you rather have quiet time by&nbsp;yourself? Maybe you need both, depending on&nbsp;what’s going on&nbsp;in&nbsp;your life. It’s helpful for you and others to&nbsp;know what you need.</li><li><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Write</strong></a><strong> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;journal. </strong>Research shows that writing or&nbsp;journaling can help relieve negative thoughts and feelings. And it&nbsp;may actually help improve your own health. You might write about your most stressful experiences. Or&nbsp;you may want to&nbsp;express your deepest thoughts and feelings. You can also write about things that make you feel good, such as&nbsp;a&nbsp;pretty day or&nbsp;a&nbsp;kind coworker or&nbsp;friend.</li></ul><ul><li><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Join</strong></a><strong> a&nbsp;support group.</strong> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Support groups</a> can meet in&nbsp;person, by&nbsp;phone, or&nbsp;online. They may help you gain new insights into what is&nbsp;happening, get ideas about how to&nbsp;cope, and help you know that you’re not alone. Many hospitals, cancer centers, community groups, and schools offer cancer support groups.</li></ul><p>Here are some ways to&nbsp;find groups near you:</p><ul><li>Call your local hospital and ask about its cancer support programs.</li><li>Ask your social worker to&nbsp;suggest groups.</li><li>Talk to&nbsp;other patients who have tried support groups.</li><li>Do&nbsp;an&nbsp;online search for groups.
