In&nbsp;a&nbsp;candid <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>conversation</a>, Carlotta bared her soul, recounting the arduous path she crossed towards self-acceptance. She started wearing makeup at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;8. For her, it&nbsp;wasn’t a&nbsp;choice; it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;question of&nbsp;survival. She spent two hours doing her makeup every morning, and this ritual became her armor against the world.</p><p>Carlotta’s struggle extended beyond her physical appearance. At&nbsp;the tender age of&nbsp;12, she was diagnosed with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>meningioma</a>, a&nbsp;benign tumor that left her face paralyzed and made her health destabilized. Her battle for survival put her into darkness, shattering her confidence and self-worth. She remembers waking up&nbsp;in&nbsp;intensive care after two weeks of&nbsp;medically induced coma, and her face was paralyzed. She recalled that moment as&nbsp;seeing a&nbsp;monster in&nbsp;the mirror.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ef2/611/0945685b7380b1a5c0e88005a0.jpg><p><h2>Her teenage years and feeling unwanted</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e30/ce6/9eca8956cea80a81c79b02b456.jpg><p>Throughout her teenage years, Carlotta was filled with insecurities, resorting to&nbsp;desperate measures in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;look like her peers. From elaborate makeup routines to&nbsp;customized contact lenses, she found rescue in&nbsp;brief solutions, only to&nbsp;be&nbsp;met with disappointment and anguish. She admitted trying everything to&nbsp;fit&nbsp;in. But no&nbsp;matter what she did, she felt like an&nbsp;outsider, unworthy of&nbsp;love and acceptance.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;failed romance that deepened her insecurities</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/da7/70e/1a2c5a59eeb9b6015136ac4bd1.jpg><p>Love her hair actually</p><p>Carlotta’s romantic relationships mirrored her deep-seated insecurities, as&nbsp;she found herself entangled in&nbsp;a&nbsp;toxic dynamic with a&nbsp;man thirteen years older than her. Their love was suffocating, marked by&nbsp;possessiveness and perpetual betrayals that she reluctantly endured. Desperate for validation and acceptance, she bent over backward to&nbsp;accommodate his every desire, convinced that it&nbsp;was the only path to&nbsp;love.</p><p>Yet, instead of&nbsp;affirming her worth, he&nbsp;incessantly chipped away at&nbsp;her self-esteem, criticizing even the most trivial aspects of&nbsp;her appearance. His hurtful words echoed in&nbsp;her mind, igniting a&nbsp;self-destructive cycle of&nbsp;doubt and inadequacy. She internalized his infidelity as&nbsp;a&nbsp;reflection of&nbsp;her own shortcomings, fulling herself with a&nbsp;feeling of&nbsp;unworthiness.</p><p><h2>Until she finally found her voice.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/342/3e5/a977335aa88f192afef696c8d3.jpg><p>Yet, amidst the darkness, a&nbsp;flicker of&nbsp;hope emerged. In&nbsp;2018, Carlotta made a&nbsp;pivotal decision—to embrace her imperfections and share her story with the world. Since then, she has garnered a&nbsp;devoted following on&nbsp;<a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a>, captivating audiences with her authenticity and resilience. Her journey culminated in&nbsp;the release of&nbsp;her book, “Incancellabile”, a&nbsp;proof of&nbsp;the power of&nbsp;self-love and acceptance.</p><p>Today, Carlotta stands tall, a&nbsp;beacon of&nbsp;inspiration for countless individuals navigating their own battles with self-image and identity. Her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>message</a> to&nbsp;all is&nbsp;that there will come a&nbsp;day when everyone understands to&nbsp;be&nbsp;deserving of&nbsp;love. A&nbsp;moment when you realize that you gave too much importance to&nbsp;things that had none.</p><p>Carlotta’s story serves as&nbsp;a&nbsp;reminder that true beauty lies not in&nbsp;perfection, but in&nbsp;embracing our flaws and celebrating our <a href=#>uniqueness</a>. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;world consumed by&nbsp;unrealistic standards and unattainable ideals, her journey is&nbsp;a&nbsp;testament to&nbsp;the transformative power of&nbsp;self-love—a journey worth embarking&nbsp;on, one imperfection at&nbsp;a&nbsp;time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZuv8%2Bepa1lqZqus7%2BMnKavnaKeu6h5zLJkn5mTmnq4tdOhZKaZm5rCsXnNqK5moV2srq%2FAjK2fnmWnnbytsYywpquklGLBsHnSnpxmoaRihXKDlmppaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
