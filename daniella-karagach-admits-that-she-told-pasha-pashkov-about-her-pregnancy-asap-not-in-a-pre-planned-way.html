Fans took the opportunity to know what happened during the big reveal to her husband, whether she surprised him with the pregnancy.</p><p>“TBH I just wanted to share it with him asap,” Karagach wrote. “I didn’t think about how or when haha. I pretty much attacked him with the news.”</p><p>The professional dancer told the fans that she found out she was pregnant on the day of the season 31 premiere. She also revealed that she told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pashkov</a> right at the moment, not wanting to delay it with an elaborate reveal. Having been together for more than a decade, it is admirable how the couple’s relationship has progressed this much.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She Found it Hard to Hide it From Joseph Baena</h2><p>Some of the first people she told about the pregnancy apart from Pashkov were the people in the wardrobe department. Even then, it was a good while before she told them only after the baby bulge was getting big and noticeable.</p><p>Karagach originally intended to inform the whole cast on the day of the season finale, but her dance partner Joseph Baena, found out earlier than anticipated. With the both of them rehearsing seven days a week, the possibilities of slipping up are high, and it seems to be the case as to what happened.</p><p>“I wanted to film a reaction video and had planned to do that at the finale,” Karagach said. “He stood next to me Sunday in camera blocking and as I opened my phone, the first thing that came up was my ultrasound.”</p><p>She added that Baena became the hardest person to hide her pregnancy from. The former <a href=# class=broken_link>Mirrorball champion</a> will be sitting out the next season of DWTS and will focus more on becoming a mother.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Original_NickCannon_Michael-Becker-FOX-220x170.jpg alt="Nick Cannon Updates Fans About His Health After Hospitalization" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w5qlop2coa5ut8CrmKCZk516orDMoqusZaSdrrV50qGcZqyfobFuvMCsn5ploJbAqbfOr2Samp%2BqwW60xKtkqaqVnLuiusKyZJqrkaV6r7vTZqCnZZFivbOxjKmjmqaemrFuw8CyZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
