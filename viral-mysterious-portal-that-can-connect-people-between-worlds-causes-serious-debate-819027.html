"The livestream provides a window between distant locations, allowing people to meet outside of their social circles and cultures, transcend geographical boundaries, and embrace the beauty of global interconnectedness."</p><p>Lord Mayor of Dublin, Daithí De Róiste, echoed this sentiment, encouraging Dubliners and visitors alike to engage with the sculpture and extend a warm welcome to the global audience. The portal was initially met with enthusiasm, with numerous performances planned for both sides of the livestream in the coming months.</p><h2>While the majority of&nbsp;responses are positive, a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>small minority</a> ruins the experience.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f84/aac/23efd2582e829e8976a4560852.jpg><p>NDZ/STAR MAX/IPx/Associated Press/East News</p><p>However, the initiative soon encountered issues when videos of inappropriate behavior from Dublin began circulating online. Instances included individuals holding up inappropriate images, displaying offensive language, and even mooning at the New York camera. Consequently, the portal was temporarily shut down as Dublin City Council <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sought</a> "technical solutions" to address the problem.</p><p>The council explained that the portal's closure was necessitated by the actions of "a very small minority of people" who engaged in inappropriate behavior. "While we cannot control all of these actions, we are implementing some technical solutions to address this," the council <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stated</a>. "We will continue to monitor the situation over the coming days with our partners in New York to ensure that portals continue to deliver a positive experience for both cities and the world."</p><p>While many people embraced the idea enthusiastically, others expressed reservations. One person <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>commented</a>, "It's a great idea if people had self-respect rather than using it to make a trashy video for likes." Additionally, some individuals raised concerns about the environmental impact of such extravagance, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>highlighting</a>, "We need to find a balance between innovation and sustainability to ensure a better future for all."</p><p><a href=# title="Elon Musk" data-link=tag>Elon Musk</a>, known for his involvement in&nbsp;advanced technology, caused a&nbsp;stir after pictures of&nbsp;<a href=#>him kissing robots</a> circulated on&nbsp;the <a href=# title=internet data-link=tag>internet</a>.
