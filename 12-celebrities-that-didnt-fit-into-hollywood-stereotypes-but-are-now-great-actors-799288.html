We’re used to&nbsp;seeing perfect people playing in&nbsp;perfect movies. They all have these impressive muscles, Greek god-like bodies, magic hair, and dazzling smiles. But let’s not forget that while some shine in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> because of&nbsp;their physical appearance, they’re still hired to&nbsp;be&nbsp;actors. That’s a&nbsp;job that requires skill and experience too, not just looks. There are many <a href=# title=talented data-link=tag>talented</a> actors out there that have managed to&nbsp;overcome the stereotype of&nbsp;the good-looking actor and succeed because of&nbsp;their <a href=# title=perseverance data-link=tag>perseverance</a> and great acting talent.</p><p>So&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> decided to&nbsp;put together a&nbsp;small compilation of&nbsp;these actors who were not only incredibly talented but also brave enough to&nbsp;fight against stereotypes in&nbsp;the industry. And in&nbsp;the end, they managed to&nbsp;get everything they wanted thanks to&nbsp;their charisma and skill.</p><p><h2>1. Amy Schumer</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a36/39a/afe6f55663aa5b7404d884012e.jpg><p>Known for her performances in&nbsp;romantic <a href=# title=comedies data-link=tag>comedies</a>, this talented actress started out as&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>stand-up comedian</a>. After playing several minor roles in&nbsp;film and television, the romantic comedy I&nbsp;Feel Pretty (2018) helped showcase how far she had come. Since then, Amy Schumer has faced <a href=#>criticism</a> for her physical appearance multiple times. Despite that, she always responds with humor and grace. That and her courage to&nbsp;face the world has made her an&nbsp;inspirational role model for many young women.</p><p><h2>2. Peter Dinklage</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d4d/7dd/3f0b0e519eb0663a7ae9071662.jpg><p>Acclaimed for his performance in&nbsp;the HBO series Game of&nbsp;Thrones, this American film, television, and theater actor knows what it&nbsp;feels to&nbsp;be&nbsp;limited in&nbsp;his choice of&nbsp;characters. Due to&nbsp;his height, <a href=#>Dinklage</a> has faced several rejections despite having more than 20&nbsp;years of&nbsp;experience in&nbsp;acting. Still, today he&nbsp;is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most awarded actors and <a href=#>living proof</a> that when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;making your dreams come true, size does not matter.</p><p><h2>3. Yalitza Aparicio</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0c9/678/fb23d3549cafaf00e39f7400e9.jpg><p>Mainly recognized for her appearance in&nbsp;Netflix’s Roma (2018), this Mexican actress became famous after she was nominated for an&nbsp;<a href=# title=Oscar data-link=tag>Oscar</a>. She is&nbsp;considered the first indigenous actress to&nbsp;have been nominated for this a&nbsp;prize and an&nbsp;important figure that’s helping break stereotypes in&nbsp;the film industry. <a href=#>Time</a><a href=#> magazine</a> included her name on&nbsp;the list of&nbsp;the 10&nbsp;best performances of&nbsp;2018. She also made it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the <a href=#>BBC</a>’s list of&nbsp;the 100 most influential women in&nbsp;the world in&nbsp;2019 thanks to&nbsp;her role in&nbsp;promoting gender equality, the rights of&nbsp;indigenous communities, and the constitutional protection of&nbsp;domestic workers.</p><p><h2>4. Octavia Spencer</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/69e/6e6/3157a5571697d913420b30b9c6.jpg><p><a href=#>Spencer</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;renowned American actress and screenwriter for film and television. She has won a&nbsp;Golden Globe, a&nbsp;BAFTA, and 3&nbsp;SAG awards. She also won an&nbsp;Oscar for her performance in&nbsp;The Help (2011). Despite her long career, she has faced limitations in&nbsp;her choice of&nbsp;roles. She clearly didn’t let that become an&nbsp;obstacle for her to&nbsp;stand out as&nbsp;a&nbsp;skilled actress and achieve her dreams. During an&nbsp;<a href=#>interview</a>, she said: “I&nbsp;wish this for all of&nbsp;my&nbsp;fellow actors, rank-and-file actors who have been kicking it&nbsp;around as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;I&nbsp;have... I&nbsp;hope that I&nbsp;am a&nbsp;beacon of&nbsp;hope for them because really and truly, they know what it’s like to&nbsp;have constant rejection and to&nbsp;have hope, so&nbsp;hopefully, I&nbsp;will represent that for them.”</p><p><h2>5. Rebel Wilson</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5c5/c41/1eec765ee4be0f9d1a27e4881e.jpg><p>Melanie Elizabeth Bownds, best known as&nbsp;<a href=#>Rebel Wilson</a>, is&nbsp;an&nbsp;Australian actress, comedian, and producer. She was launched to&nbsp;fame thanks to&nbsp;her <a href=#>performance</a> as&nbsp;<a href=# title="Fat Amy" data-link=tag>Fat Amy</a> in&nbsp;Pitch Perfect (2012). This same role granted her the Best Breakthrough Performance award at&nbsp;the MTV Movie Awards. She also shared the Best Musical Moment award with other stars from Pitch Perfect. She continues to&nbsp;face criticism for her physical appearance, but it’s her charisma, good vibes, and a&nbsp;great <a href=#>workout routine</a> that have inspired many young women all around the world.</p><p><h2>6. Rossy de&nbsp;Palma</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/093/80d/bf683f5dfb96143e6abaf909f9.jpg><p>This <a href=#>Spanish actress</a> became famous thanks to&nbsp;her appearance in&nbsp;award-winning director Pedro Almodóvar’s film Mujeres al&nbsp;borde de&nbsp;un&nbsp;ataque de&nbsp;nervios (Women on&nbsp;the Verge of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Nervous Breakdown). Recognized as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the <a href=#>Almodóvar Girls</a>, she and other actresses, who were chosen by&nbsp;the director, stood out in&nbsp;Spanish cinema. They did not necessarily stand out for being especially pretty, distinguished, or&nbsp;glamorous, but more so&nbsp;for being original and talented. With more than 30&nbsp;years of&nbsp;an&nbsp;artistic career under her belt, Rossy continues to&nbsp;be&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most <a href=#>acclaimed</a> celebrities in&nbsp;European cinema.</p><p><h2>7. Whoopi Goldberg</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/993/275/912ef85a269222f3aa4125c7f5.jpg><p>Whoopi Goldberg is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the few people that has walked down the red carpet to&nbsp;win all <a href=#>4</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;America’s top entertainment industry awards: Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony. With nearly<a href=#> 40&nbsp;years</a> of&nbsp;experience as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress, she became famous for her appearance in&nbsp;Spielberg’s The Color Purple. She won a&nbsp;Golden Globe for Best Actress in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=Drama data-link=tag>Drama</a> for her role in&nbsp;the film. From then&nbsp;on, her career took off with one success after another. However, she has also had to&nbsp;deal with Hollywood stereotypes. At&nbsp;the 2016 Oscar awards gala, she was <a href=#>mistaken</a> for Oprah Winfrey.</p><p><h2>8. Jack Black</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e1b/d67/fede5a5924b36699a377b0ddeb.jpg><p>This American <a href=#>actor</a>, musician, and comedian has conquered the hearts of&nbsp;several generations since he&nbsp;appeared in&nbsp;the now-classic comedy School of&nbsp;Rock. His excellent performance led him to&nbsp;be&nbsp;nominated for a&nbsp;Golden Globe as&nbsp;Best Actor in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Musical or&nbsp;Comedy. At&nbsp;first glance, we&nbsp;might think that his physical appearance has caused him problems, but that couldn’t be&nbsp;further from the truth.</p><p><h2>9. John Bradley-West</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b74/e4f/3e9d4e5f01915b5d6ecfe35f3f.jpg><p>The British actor is&nbsp;mostly known for playing Samwell Tarly in&nbsp;HBO’s series Game of&nbsp;Thrones. During an&nbsp;<a href=#>interview</a> at&nbsp;the Conan O’Brien show, he&nbsp;claimed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;really grateful to&nbsp;the producers of&nbsp;the series. That’s because they played an&nbsp;important role in&nbsp;helping him accept his body just the way it&nbsp;is. In&nbsp;fact, HBO producers were looking for someone that looked exactly like him, and that clearly contributed a&nbsp;lot to&nbsp;improve his career.</p><p><h2>10. Josh Gad</h2></p><p>American actor, comedian, and singer Josh Gad became known worldwide for his role as&nbsp;Olaf in&nbsp;Frozen. Lending his voice to&nbsp;our favorite <a href=#>snowman</a> earned him 2&nbsp;Annie Awards. But before success knocked at&nbsp;his door, the actor confessed to&nbsp;having received a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;rejections letters. He&nbsp;was thinking about quitting acting when a&nbsp;<a href=#>comment</a> from his mother gave him the little push he&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;go&nbsp;on. Gad’s mother said: “I’m disappointed in&nbsp;you. You spent 15&nbsp;years dreaming of&nbsp;this and only 3&nbsp;years trying, I&nbsp;think it’s cowardly to&nbsp;give&nbsp;up.” He&nbsp;then decided to&nbsp;keep trying his luck instead of&nbsp;giving&nbsp;up. In&nbsp;the end, rejections helped him to&nbsp;understand himself better and to&nbsp;discover what kind of&nbsp;actor he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;become. Today, he&nbsp;feels very happy and proud of&nbsp;what he&nbsp;has accomplished.</p><p><h2>11. Ron Perlman</h2></p><p>The most remembered character of&nbsp;this amazingly versatile actor is&nbsp;Hellboy, from the film of&nbsp;the same name. Perlman is&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href=#>actor</a> who has more than 40&nbsp;years of&nbsp;experience in&nbsp;acting and voicing. His talent has led him to&nbsp;<a href=#>work</a> on&nbsp;countless movies and television shows, and he&nbsp;has even voiced different animated characters for films and video games.</p><p><h2>12. Ken Jeong</h2></p><p>He&nbsp;is&nbsp;recognized for his performance as&nbsp;Leslie Chow or&nbsp;Mr. Chow in&nbsp;the trilogy The Hangover. Apparently, his wife <a href=#>predicted</a> that the nude scene he&nbsp;did in&nbsp;the film would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge success because it&nbsp;would allow the male audience to&nbsp;return home and feel reassured about themselves and their physical appearance. This great comedian just can’t miss an&nbsp;opportunity to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;joke about his alleged physical defects. It’s this sense of&nbsp;madness and spontaneity that’s so&nbsp;characteristic of&nbsp;him, that led him to&nbsp;become one of&nbsp;the most acclaimed comedians in&nbsp;the film industry.</p><p>Tell&nbsp;us, what do&nbsp;you think of&nbsp;these actors and their experiences in&nbsp;the world of&nbsp;Hollywood? What other actors do&nbsp;you think are great for their presence on&nbsp;screen and excellent performances?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5zecKeo56aop7BqrHSZquhmaRisaqwza1kn6GkYravwM5mn6iknK7EsLvDZqqtnaKavLXFz56qZpqlqXqivsRmpaivXZy%2Fpq3TZpicrJ%2BnwG6DmHJpcXBf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
