1. SpongeBob SquarePants
The fun and friendly sponge has been with us since 1997, and, like everyone else, Bob has also changed over the past 20+ years."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

With the passing of&nbsp;the episodes, the series was modernized along with new technologies. In&nbsp;season nine, the image quality was already sharper, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;began to&nbsp;be&nbsp;done by&nbsp;computer, and in&nbsp;the 2015&nbsp;movie, 3D&nbsp;details were added. The popular series is&nbsp;still on&nbsp;the air, and we&nbsp;are waiting for its 13th <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>season</a>.</p><p><h2>2. <i>The Simpsons</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ad5/dfa/c06e485386b6855ae4e9c6c185.jpg><p>In&nbsp;1987, everyone’s favorite yellow family was part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;single <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>animated segment</a> on&nbsp;<i>The Tracey Ullman Show</i>, but its success led to&nbsp;its own series. Initially, the characters and scenery were rather crude, with uneven lines and unusual proportions. Then they were modified to&nbsp;what we&nbsp;know today.</p><p>The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>drawings</a> were done by&nbsp;hand and painted in&nbsp;a&nbsp;computerized way, but in&nbsp;2010, the entire production moved to&nbsp;digitalization, which accelerated the process of&nbsp;editing episodes.</p><p>As&nbsp;for their stories, the changes in&nbsp;scriptwriters caused the plot to&nbsp;transform constantly. In&nbsp;the past, we&nbsp;saw real and everyday life situations, but later, the series got crazier and more surreal. Although many fans believe <i>The Simpsons</i> lost its humor a&nbsp;long time ago, it&nbsp;continues to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;success with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>31&nbsp;seasons</a>.</p><p><h2>3. <i>The Powerpuff Girls</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5e9/329/8837c754cc9f93a8126b922d6f.jpg><p>The little sisters with superpowers who fight to&nbsp;save their city from monsters and strange creatures appeared on&nbsp;the Cartoon Network screen more than twenty years ago. The show had <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>six seasons</a> until 2004 when it&nbsp;stopped airing. But, in&nbsp;2016, it&nbsp;had a&nbsp;reboot that was not very well <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>received </a>by&nbsp;the public. The cartoons were different and of&nbsp;better quality, but the storyline did not convince its fans.</p><p>Despite the failed attempt to&nbsp;revive one of&nbsp;the most popular series of&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the millennium, it&nbsp;was recently <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>announced</a> that there will be&nbsp;live action, now with the sisters in&nbsp;their adulthood, which promises not to&nbsp;disappoint.</p><p><h2>4. Scooby-Doo</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d0c/b53/dd8a9d5e879ed6ffbb22f1e432.jpg><p>If&nbsp;there is&nbsp;one cartoon that has been part of&nbsp;every generation, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;<i>Scooby-Doo</i>. The talking dog and his group of&nbsp;friends have been solving mysteries since 1969. The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>television franchise</a> went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;have thirteen adaptations, the latest being <i>Scooby-Doo and Who Do&nbsp;You Think,</i> which aired in&nbsp;2019.</p><p>Over the years, the drawings have changed significantly, going through different strokes and image quality.</p><p><h2>5. <i>Teen Titans</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/514/1d8/0df50859d287fee809fe5742e7.jpg><p>The DC&nbsp;Comics superheroes had their first animated <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>adaptation</a> aired on&nbsp;Cartoon Network in&nbsp;2003. This had five seasons until 2005, but in&nbsp;2013, the characters returned renewed and with a&nbsp;new look in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Teen Titans Go!</i></a><br>In&nbsp;the first series, the characters had a&nbsp;comic-book look, and the plot revolved around the exploits they carried out to&nbsp;save the city. In&nbsp;the second version, they were drawn in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>chibi</i></a> format<i>,</i> a&nbsp;type of&nbsp;drawing characteristic of&nbsp;Japanese anime. Regarding its plot, this one is&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit more childish.</p><p><h2>6. Winx Club</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5ed/1e5/9bbac356e697664ce91688f734.jpg><p>The Italian <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>series</a> tells the life of&nbsp;a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;teenagers who have magical powers and live adventures while learning to&nbsp;use their fairy magic. It&nbsp;premiered in&nbsp;2004, and since then, it&nbsp;has been on&nbsp;the air for eight<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#> seasons</a>.</p><p>But over the years, the cartoons have changed, and not only did their image quality improve, but also the characters have acquired characteristics closer to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>anime</a>.</p><p><h2>7. <i>Tom and Jerry</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cc6/61a/d3097856529c93138e73edcc00.jpg><p>The classic story of&nbsp;the cat chasing the mouse has accompanied several generations since its beginnings, which date back to&nbsp;1940. Throughout its history, these animated shorts passed through the hands of&nbsp;several <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>directors and producers</a> but always kept the essence of&nbsp;poor Tom and his failed attempts to&nbsp;catch Jerry.</p><p>Released in&nbsp;2014, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Tom and Jerry Show</i> </a>series modernized the characters and their stories. Its image quality is&nbsp;also much more advanced.</p><p><h2>8. Looney Tunes</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/710/94f/ccd2dd5ba881d4b5419ea072af.jpg><p>Continuing with the old classics, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Looney Tunes</i></a> are the longest-lived since their creation dates back to&nbsp;1930. That year, Warner Bros. wanted to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;musical shorts to&nbsp;promote their original music, and since then, the different characters and their stories have been appearing over the years.</p><p>In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;being an&nbsp;emblem of&nbsp;television, the <i>Looney Tunes</i> have movies, and even a&nbsp;video game, and more short films have been created, the latest being <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Looney Tunes Cartoons</i></a>, released in&nbsp;2020.</p><p><h2>9. <i>The Fairly OddParents</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6e5/0a5/4037ac5f409b3d32985a754289.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>We&nbsp;first met</a> the boy in&nbsp;the pink cap and his two magical godparents in&nbsp;1998, thanks to&nbsp;Nickelodeon. The series has ten seasons, and although no&nbsp;more episodes are produced, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the longest-running series on&nbsp;the channel, which continues to&nbsp;repeat&nbsp;it.</p><p>The changes in&nbsp;the series were not only physical (in&nbsp;the ninth season, it&nbsp;moved to&nbsp;high definition and widescreen format) but also in&nbsp;the story, as&nbsp;new characters were integrated into the lives of&nbsp;Timmy, Cosmo, and Wanda, such as&nbsp;Poof, the son of&nbsp;the wizards.</p><p><h2>10. Pokémon</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8b1/75e/54791556fe8719bfa2a1868c57.jpg><p>Although <i>Pokémon</i> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;franchise that goes beyond television, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>since 1997</a>, we&nbsp;can see on&nbsp;screen Ash Ketchum along with his faithful companion, Pikachu, and his group of&nbsp;friends, training the little monsters to&nbsp;be&nbsp;Pokémon Masters. The animated series has 23&nbsp;seasons, with the last one premiering in&nbsp;2019.</p><p>In&nbsp;this <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>new</a> version, the cartoons have a&nbsp;different look, and the story revolves around the beginnings of&nbsp;its protagonist. Another character named&nbsp;Go was even incorporated.</p><p><h2>Bonus: Comparisons between old and new cartoons</h2></p><p><h2><i>SpongeBob</i> vs&nbsp;<i>Toon Marty</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5ef/820/4be9855e6a89d9298434061aaa.jpg><p>Although he&nbsp;doesn’t live under the sea, we&nbsp;can find similarities between Sponge Bob and the protagonist of&nbsp;the 2017 cartoon <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Toon Marty</i></a>&nbsp;— both are energetic characters who always manage to&nbsp;have fun with their friends. Even their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>voices</a> in&nbsp;the Latin dub are similar.</p><p><h2><i>The Simpsons </i>vs<i>&nbsp;The Casagrandes</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d1b/9e5/be85cd50cfb010b246ffab4461.jpg><p>In&nbsp;this 2019&nbsp;sketch, we&nbsp;met the Casagrandes, a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>family</a> of&nbsp;Latino descent residing in&nbsp;the United States.
