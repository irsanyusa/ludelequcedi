His own popular podcast The Viall Files will also fall under the Envy umbrella.</p><p>Nick Viall first gained fame being the runner-up on two seasons of The Bachelorette. He then appeared on Bachelor in Paradise before starring as The Bachelor himself in 2017. More recently, Viall impressed viewers with his perseverance on the grueling reality competition <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Special Forces: World’s Toughest Test</a>.</p><p>Viall has leveraged his celebrity status to transition into hosting the popular podcast The Viall Files. With over 150 million downloads to date, the show earned Viall a People’s Choice Award nomination.</p><p>Now, Viall is expanding his media presence by launching Envy Media. The company allows Viall to extend his brand beyond The Viall Files and produce new content.</p><p>The involvement of Maloney and Kathan gives Envy Media built-in star power from the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanderpump Rules</a> fandom. With his savvy business moves, Viall continues to prove there is an opportunity beyond just reality TV fame.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nick-viall-questioned-katie-maloney-about-kaitlyn-bristowe-zac-clark>Nick Viall Questioned Katie Maloney About Kaitlyn Bristowe, Zac Clark</h2><p>On a recent episode of The Viall Files, Viall pressed guest Maloney about the drama surrounding <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kaitlyn Bristowe</a>‘s New Year’s Eve party.</p><p>Bristowe hosted a Nashville bash on December 31 and was seen getting cozy with Zac Clark, former fiancé of Bachelorette Tayshia Adams. This prompted cheating speculation from fans, given Bristowe had recently split from Jason Tartick.</p><p>When Maloney mentioned attending Bristowe’s “little party,” Viall hinted at the resulting drama. Maloney admitted she was aware but didn’t want to throw anyone under the bus. Viall asked if something romantic was going on between Bristowe and Clark. Maloney carefully replied that wasn’t for her to say, stopping short of outright denial.</p><p>Maloney felt the harsh criticism of Bristowe was unfair, as if she’d committed a serious crime just for hanging out with someone. She said people were treating Bristowe as if they knew more than they actually did.</p><p>Despite fishing for intel, Viall stressed he didn’t care who dated within Bachelor Nation. He said single people have every right to move on. While Maloney treaded lightly, Viall tried getting to the bottom of the juicy rumors. But he maintained Bristowe should be free to date post-split, without judgment.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/The-Masked-Singer-Andrew-Lloyd-Webber-Night.jpg alt="Andrew Lloyd Webber Reveals He Hired a Priest to Remove a Poltergeist in His Home" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zaKapGWmnq6tuIylmK6mk52ytHnLop2eq6SuuaZ5wqikqZmernq0sdNmq6hloKe8pcHCnmSpp5SYrrTAjKGmrKyVmXqjxYyvmKeclae9trnPZqmupJWoeqS7jKyrmqqjZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
