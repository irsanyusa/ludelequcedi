Reportedly, Temple was “<a href=# rel=noopener>whining</a>” over her parents sipping old-fashioneds, which also come with their offshoot’s signature maraschino cherry, and so the waitstaff mixed up a teetotal version for her. (Some recollections have the drink being first mixed at the Hollywood eatery Chasen’s, while others say it was the <a href=# rel=noopener>Brown Derby restaurant</a>, also in Hollywood; the <a href=# rel=noopener>Royal Hawaiian Hotel</a> has also said that their bartenders came up with the cocktail.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">(<b>PHOTOS: <a href=#>From Child-Star to Diplomat: Shirley Temple’s Life in Pictures</a></b>)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Still, even the ingredients are in dispute. There’s definitely a dash of grenadine and a maraschino cherry, but the soda can consist of ginger ale, lemon-lime soda or a mix. Some recipes also include orange juice.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One thing is for sure, however: the star herself didn’t want anyone making money off her signature drink by using her name. In 1988, when there were attempts to market a bottled soda bearing the name “Shirley Temple,” she brought civil lawsuits claiming that her name was not a generic term, and that using it as such was an invasion of her privacy. As she <a href=# rel=noopener>told the New York Times</a> at the time: “All a celebrity has is their name.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For Shirley Temple, considering her name is also an iconic beverage, that’s a lot to have.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">(<strong>MORE</strong>: <a href=#>Shirley Temple, Former Hollywood Child Star, Dies at 85</a>)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvbmVufLS0yKujnrFdqbKuvMueZJ2qmaO4cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
