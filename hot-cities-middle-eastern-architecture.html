That compares to 77% of households having AC in 2001.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But with air conditioning comes both environmental and socioeconomic consequences. Air conditioning is believed to cause 1,950 million tons of CO2 emissions per year around the world, accounting for almost 4% of global carbon emissions. It’s also drive up electricity bills, making it unaffordable for some low income people, who are <a href=#>more likely to require emergency room visits</a> due to extreme heat.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It doesn’t have to be like this, though. In hot climates around the world, people have been designing sustainable buildings to withstand extreme heat for hundreds of years, says John Onyango, a professor at the University of Notre Dame School of Architecture.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“In the U.S. we've been so used to feeding on cheap energy that we forgot to innovate,” says Onyango. “We have many techniques we can use to reduce heat, and we can actually borrow from what happens in the Middle East and look at Iran or look at Dubai and Turkey.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Harnessing the wind to cool interiors</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In some scorching cities, ancient forms are being used in modern construction.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In Masdar City in Abu Dhabi, a four-story building that serves as Siemens’s Middle Eastern headquarters was designed to cool itself with a minimal use of air conditioning. It was one of the first buildings in the region to receive a <a href=#>LEED platinum certification</a> from the U.S. Green Buildings council, meaning it is among the most sustainable buildings on the planet. The Siemens building, which was completed in 2014, includes traditional barajeel along with carefully shaped ceiling structures that allow for natural light while preventing overheating in the hot desert climate.<br></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Siemens-Masdar-City-Dubai.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Barajeels have passively cooled buildings for centuries. These wind towers can lower temperatures by up to 50 degrees Fahrenheit depending on how they are designed and the levels of wind, according to Onyango. They work by funneling hot winds from outside to the lower floors of the building or even underground, where the air is cooled naturally. The cooled air is then released inside the building.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So long as there is wind flowing, the barajeel works without ever requiring electricity. Versions of these windcatcher systems can even be used in high rises, according to Onyango.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In tall buildings, wind can be funneled through chimney-like structures called chases, says Onyango. The air flowing through the chases is then cooled by the mass of the walls, and then brought back into the building.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Another way to significantly improve the ability of a building to cool itself is to use high domed-shaped roofs, says Amin Al-Habaibeh, a professor at the School of Architecture Design and the Built Environment at Nottingham Trent University.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The advantage of having a dome structure is that part of the building will be in the sun, but the other side of the building will be in the shadow,” says Al-Habaibeh.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This means that the heat from the sun will be naturally dispersed and less concentrated than in structures with flat roofs, he says. Using natural materials—like the stone and mud used to make homes in hot climates in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia—can help make buildings more sustainable and heat resistant, Al-Habaibeh says. In cities like Sana’a in Yemen and Djenné in Mali, many of these centuries-old, mud-based buildings are still used today.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“These environmentally friendly materials would absorb moisture during the night and evaporate during the day creating a sort of natural cooling effect,” he says.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Energy-efficient construction materials</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Unlike the production process for steel or concrete, the production of stone and mud bricks does not lead to large amounts of carbon emissions. In the U.S. these materials could be used as filler material to help pad the underlying structure of walls, says Onyango.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">However, all these building method remain unpopular in the U.S. due to a combination of lack of skilled workers to procure natural materials and the reluctance of building developers to pay the additional costs associated with traditional architecture.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“These methods are cheaper in the long run, but in the short run they may look expensive,” says Onyango. Building developers may be unwilling to pay the extra costs associated with traditional materials and structural designs. However, in the long run, because the building owner will pay much less for air conditioning, owners would usually save money, says Onyango.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But as temperatures climb, U.S. cities are going to have to make changes. Cities like <a href=#>Los Angeles</a> and <a href=#>New York</a> have gone to great lengths to repaint rooftops of existing buildings white over the last 15 years in an attempt to reduce heat. Others, like Miami, are <a href=#>planting new trees</a>, which can help reduce temperatures by <a href=#>up to 10 degrees</a> with enough foliage. Borrowing techniques from cities long used to living in hot climates only make sense.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Correction, August 7</strong></p><p>The original version of this story misstated that Siemens' Middle Eastern headquarters cools itself without the use of air conditioning.
