Enjoy!!”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The photos feature a young director Tim Burton nervously giggling while holding snakes for the movie’s pet store fire scene, Reubens reading a script while propped on a stool, and actress E.G. Daly peering through a camera.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The film, a cult classic borrowing liberally from the 1948 Italian film The Bicycle Thief, follows a man-child, played by Herman, whose bike is stolen, leading him on a chase to reclaim it across the United States. The film itself was an extension of a popular 1980 stage show, The Pee-wee Herman Show, following the comic escapades of Herman, and led into Reubens starring in the television show Pee-wee’s Playhouse.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The film also launched the careers of Burton, who cemented his signature, quirky directing style, and music composer Danny Elfman, who went on to work with Burton on many projects.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The film quickly became a hit, furthering Reubens’ odd character sketch as a man with a childish inquisitiveness and propensity for falling into silly situations. Reubens’ characteristic, trilly laugh and his standard comeback—”I know you are, but what am I?”—quickly became pop culture staples.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Herman’s blog post also alerted fans to an <a href=# rel=noopener>upcoming Pee-wee adventure</a>, Pee-wee’s Big Holiday, to be released on Netflix in March 2016.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Correction</b>: The original version of this story misstated the participants in the forthcoming Pee-Wee Herman project for Netflix. The film will star Reubens and be directed by John Lee.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZscWdngnN%2FjqmcnmWnmrK0ecGinmaZlKuyr8DUq5xmppWserG0zq2mrGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
