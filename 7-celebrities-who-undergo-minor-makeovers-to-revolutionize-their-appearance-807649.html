1. Tom Cruise
Actors must have great-looking teeth, and Tom Cruise, who has ruled the movie industry since the 1980s, has undoubtedly worked hard to achieve his current grin."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Tom Cruise</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5f3/6e1/064e8a528ba215d9818b8500f1.jpg><p>Actors must have great-looking teeth, and <a href=# title="Tom Cruise" data-link=tag>Tom Cruise</a>, who has ruled the movie industry since the 1980s, has undoubtedly worked hard to&nbsp;achieve his current grin. When Cruise first rose to&nbsp;fame, his teeth had not yet undergone extensive cosmetic dental surgery. A&nbsp;young Tom purposely ripped the cap from his front teeth while playing Steve Randle in&nbsp;1983’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Outsiders</i></a>.</p><p>On&nbsp;the other hand, the performer had never lacked confidence. Tom Cruise’s teeth had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;corrected over time, and the actor had to&nbsp;go&nbsp;through lengthy therapy. At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;40, he&nbsp;wore <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>braces</a> for the first time because his teeth were misaligned, and he&nbsp;could then stretch them and smile with his sparkling teeth.</p><p><h2>2. Demi Lovato</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b31/242/5cf2c152b1b0b47f31f535a19b.jpg><p><a href=# title="Demi Lovato" data-link=tag>Demi Lovato</a>, the Disney star, has changed little about her appearance over the years, and she’s had no&nbsp;plastic surgery to&nbsp;correct minor blemishes. On&nbsp;the other hand, Demi has always enjoyed changing her style, particularly her haircut.</p><p>Lovato came out as&nbsp;a&nbsp;non-binary in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2021</a>. The singer leveraged her notoriety to&nbsp;raise public awareness of&nbsp;what it&nbsp;means to&nbsp;be&nbsp;non-binary. She said she does not <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recognize</a> herself in&nbsp;older photographs in&nbsp;which she appears to&nbsp;be&nbsp;highly feminine, and as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, she wanted to&nbsp;entirely transform her look.</p><p>“The person I&nbsp;am today with short hair and the person that I’ve been over the past year publicly, I&nbsp;mean, that’s who&nbsp;I feel like I&nbsp;am.”</p><p><h2>3. Adele</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ee3/b7e/3e8f16532796f00bcc78425c20.jpg><p><a href=# title=Adele data-link=tag>Adele</a>’s heavenly voice has wowed audiences since she debuted in&nbsp;the music industry more than a&nbsp;decade ago. The artist has always kept her personal life private, only stepping into the public to&nbsp;promote her songs. In&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2020</a>, however, she astonished everyone when she shared an&nbsp;Instagram photo of&nbsp;her significant <a href=# title="weight loss" data-link=tag>weight loss</a> and gorgeous makeover.</p><p>Owing to&nbsp;several wise lifestyle changes, she’s shed ’100 pounds’ and completely transformed her body. She had <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>declared</a>: “My&nbsp;body’s been objectified my&nbsp;entire career. I&nbsp;understand why it’s a&nbsp;shock. Visually, I&nbsp;represented a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;women. But I’m still the same person.”</p><p><h2>4. Ariana Grande</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/892/c22/5a19f75e1eaeda7dc911ea4dd6.jpg><p>Since leaving the television series <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Victorious</i></a>, where she rose to&nbsp;fame, Ariana has pursued a&nbsp;solo career as&nbsp;a&nbsp;singer, and she has radically transformed her life and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>appearance</a>. Her style has developed, moving away from the fresh teenage girl image and toward her own distinctive look made up&nbsp;of&nbsp;her long ponytail, eyeliner, and glamorous clothing. Ariana is&nbsp;now nearly unrecognizable, but she has surely evolved into a&nbsp;fantastic woman.</p><p><h2>5. Miley Cyrus</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/757/c80/d71a2d58929705758b941996b6.jpg><p><a href=# title="Miley Cyrus" data-link=tag>Miley Cyrus</a> has had many <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>makeovers</a> over her career, ranging from Hannah Montana’s blonde wig to&nbsp;her short and innovative haircut. Despite not having the same baby face and naivety she had as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child, Miley has kept her beauty without resorting to&nbsp;surgery, and the only major change she has made to&nbsp;her appearance is&nbsp;to&nbsp;align her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>teeth</a> to&nbsp;straighten her grin.</p><p><h2>6. Chris Pratt</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f6a/00b/2eeb2f5cb582ab0c7da5bc214e.jpg><p><a href=# title="Chris Pratt" data-link=tag>Chris Pratt</a>, the Marvel actor who gained weight for his role in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Parks and Recreation</i></a>, has gone on&nbsp;a&nbsp;long <a href=# title=diet data-link=tag>diet</a> and shed 60&nbsp;pounds. For the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2013</a> film <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Guardians of&nbsp;the Galaxy</i></a>, the actor lost that much weight in&nbsp;less than six months. Chris had been through a&nbsp;dark period in&nbsp;his life before his transformation, and while the weight-loss journey had been difficult, he&nbsp;was finally feeling better and loving himself.</p><p><h2>7. Lady Gaga</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e97/937/46514f5857a1d49393639e57f3.jpg><p>We&nbsp;all remember Lady Gaga’s quirky and controversial clothes during her meteoric rise to&nbsp;fame in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2009</a>. At&nbsp;each public event, the singer stunned everyone by&nbsp;arriving in&nbsp;bizarre outfits with wild hairstyles and makeup.</p><p>Nowadays, Gaga continues to&nbsp;dazzle all who listen to&nbsp;her music, but she has changed a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>appearance</a>, particularly when she starred in&nbsp;the film <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>A&nbsp;Star Is&nbsp;Born</i></a><i> </i>alongside Bradley Cooper. The American singer has opted for a&nbsp;style that highlights her natural beauty.</p><p>Which celebrity do&nbsp;you believe has undergone the most dramatic makeover?</p><p>Tom Cruise’s unwavering <a href=#>devotion to&nbsp;his mother</a>, Mary, has deeply influenced his personal and professional life. From a&nbsp;tumultuous childhood marked by&nbsp;frequent relocations and his father’s abandonment, Cruise emerged as&nbsp;a&nbsp;pillar of&nbsp;strength for his family. At&nbsp;just&nbsp;11, he&nbsp;supported his mother and sisters, prioritizing their needs over his own aspirations. Even as&nbsp;he&nbsp;rose to&nbsp;Hollywood stardom, Cruise’s bond with his mother remained unbreakable, with Mary often accompanying him to&nbsp;events. Their profound connection persisted until her passing in&nbsp;2017, with Cruise attributing much of&nbsp;his success to&nbsp;the values she instilled in&nbsp;him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZIRur8SlnJuqmam2pr%2BMsJ%2BoZaWjsaa%2BxqhkpqGepL9uucCknKiulafAbsDOZqmerp%2BhwrW1zqegs51dqbWmtdFmmKmolZa%2ForrCnmRxaGdrgXp7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
