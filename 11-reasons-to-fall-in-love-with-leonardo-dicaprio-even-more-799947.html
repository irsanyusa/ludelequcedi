It’s interesting that among the candidates for the main role in&nbsp;this film, there was a&nbsp;close friend of&nbsp;DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire. After being picked over his friend at&nbsp;the audition, Leo persuaded the producers to&nbsp;take him into the project as&nbsp;well. So&nbsp;Maguire got the role of&nbsp;Chuck Bolger.</p></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f08/eeb/3f74a4537c8ed478cde27c2a6e.jpg><ul readability=4.3067867036011><li readability=4.7432024169184><p>DiCaprio almost became a&nbsp;breakdancer. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href=#>interview</a> with Oprah Winfrey, the actor admitted that, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;teenager, he&nbsp;was seriously considering dedicating himself to&nbsp;dancing and he&nbsp;even won a&nbsp;competition held in&nbsp;the small German town where he&nbsp;was <a href=#>visiting</a> his grandmother.

At&nbsp;every opportunity, the actor thanks Irmelin (that’s his mom’s name!). The 2016&nbsp;BAFTA ceremony was no&nbsp;exception. Addressing his mother sitting in&nbsp;the audience, DiCaprio <a href=#>said</a>, “I&nbsp;would not be&nbsp;standing up&nbsp;here if&nbsp;it&nbsp;weren’t for this person.

A&nbsp;DJ&nbsp;was playing in&nbsp;the grand foyer. And we&nbsp;danced with around 20&nbsp;other people. When “Billie Jean” started playing, everyone formed a&nbsp;ring and started clapping their hands. At&nbsp;some point, DiCaprio bumped into&nbsp;me, and then grabbed my&nbsp;hand and led me&nbsp;into a&nbsp;circle. We&nbsp;had a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;fun dancing for a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;minutes until&nbsp;I saw a&nbsp;colleague leaving the party and&nbsp;I left the circle. Noticing this, Leo gave me&nbsp;a&nbsp;little salute. It&nbsp;was the most charming moment I’ve had with someone who accidentally bumped into&nbsp;me. <a href=#>©&nbsp;Alexandra Leh&nbsp;/ Quora</a></p></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c75/24d/d994db554983b15ec9826b0573.jpg><ul readability=4.8842105263158><li readability=12.698947368421><p>We&nbsp;went to&nbsp;the coolest club in&nbsp;the city, where, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;turned out, DiCaprio himself was hanging out. Having lied to&nbsp;the bouncers saying that we&nbsp;were with him, me&nbsp;and my&nbsp;friend, who was just as&nbsp;big a&nbsp;fan as&nbsp;I&nbsp;was, made our way to&nbsp;his lounge. Having noticed&nbsp;us, Leo held out his hand and greeted&nbsp;us. I&nbsp;replied somehow. And here we&nbsp;were, standing and smiling at&nbsp;each other. And suddenly my&nbsp;friend said, “I&nbsp;love you!” These 3&nbsp;words marked the end of&nbsp;our evening and became a&nbsp;wake-up call for the guards that crazy fans had appeared in&nbsp;the establishment. We&nbsp;were immediately escorted out. But we&nbsp;got back&nbsp;in. Seeing&nbsp;us again, Leo smiled. He&nbsp;was apparently surprised by&nbsp;how we&nbsp;had managed to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it. In&nbsp;the end, we&nbsp;danced with him for about 15&nbsp;minutes and still managed to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;precious photo before we&nbsp;were kicked out again. But we&nbsp;didn’t care. We&nbsp;got the best Christmas present ever. <a href=#>©&nbsp;Anonymous&nbsp;/ Quora</a></p></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0e6/4a5/78b33a59f1b45fcc441e671f18.jpg><p>Do&nbsp;you follow DiCaprio’s work?
