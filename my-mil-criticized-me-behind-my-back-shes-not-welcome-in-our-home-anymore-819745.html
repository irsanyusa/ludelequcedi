This is Angie's story.
I was once quite large and if your husband didn't mind, not their place to say anything."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Second how is wearing a skirt and tanktop in your own home disrespectful? I'm so sick of hearing woman/girls need to cover up more because it is distracting to men/boys. She has every right to not want them back in her home. This mil couldn't even talk to the woman herself had to speak with her husband like it's up to him to decide what his wife wears. I hope this husband backed her up and told his mother to shut up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/655/618/2515455d99809dc1846afb20fa.jpg><p>Your house, your rules. Period</p><p>Thanks for getting in touch, Angie! We’ve got some advice that we think might help you handle this sensitive situation.</p><p><h2>Define your boundaries.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d52/03f/beed66530cb85ee3079c22369f.jpg><p><strong>Have a conversation with your husband</strong> about the need to<strong> set clear boundaries </strong>with his mother regarding her comments about your appearance or behavior. Make it clear that <strong>such remarks are unacceptable and will not be tolerated</strong> in your home.</p><p>Encourage your husband to <strong>actively support you</strong> in maintaining these boundaries and to communicate them to his mother if necessary.</p><p><h2>Initiate a direct conversation.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/944/6e0/4afd7e5db299a29e6ec68246ba.jpg><p>Set up a private meeting with your mother-in-law to directly address her comments. Approach the conversation with <strong>calmness</strong> and <strong>respect</strong>, explaining how her remarks have impacted you. Make it clear that, while you respect her opinion, <strong>you have the right to dress as you prefer in your own home</strong>. Encourage open communication and make an effort to understand her perspective as well.</p><p><h2>Lead by&nbsp;example.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/64c/a7b/1d5ad45300bfaa2fd2bcab2a2f.jpg><p>Let your confidence shine in how you act and carry yourself. <strong>Keep dressing in a way that makes you feel good and comfortable</strong> at home, regardless of any judgmental comments.</p><p>By consistently showing your confidence, you may change how others see things and make it clear that you won’t be influenced or shamed for your choices.</p><p><h2>Seek professional support.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6a6/3fc/7eb94551c1be26351eed64744d.jpg><p>If the situation continues or becomes more difficult to manage, it might be wise to seek help from a therapist or counselor.</p><p><strong>A professional can guide you through complex family dynamics</strong>, help you establish healthy boundaries, and <strong>provide coping strategies </strong>for handling tough conversations and interactions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6ecyio2abop7Bqq%2FIs5ydZZ2aeqOxx6KlnWWdrnqjrcKkZKyglah6r7vTZq6epJOkuqZ5yKdkqK2iYrWwucRmmKexnaS%2FpnmXanBwbGVk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
