During his time as the host of the show, we’ve seen some fun and entertaining moments by the popular TV personality. These are the best and most memorable moments he’s had on AGT.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-nick-cannon-kicks-contestant-bellow-the-belt>1. Nick Cannon Kicks Contestant Bellow the Belt</h2><p>Grand Master Qi Feilong showcased his kung fu and energy manipulation skills during his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AGT</a> season nine audition. Together with a timid translator, they asked for the assistance of the show’s host for the final part of the act. Cannon then proceeded to kick the contestant on his crotch upon his instructions. The act that is apparently supposed to showcase Feilong’s durability became hilarious and comedic thanks to the host.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gjl4A2sgMZU</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. He Becomes a Part of the Act</h2><p>When vaudeville duo act Kamikaze Fireflies auditioned on AGT season nine, they asked for Cannon’s kind assistance. The host kindly obliged and he was then used as a stepping platform for the contestant, Rob Williams. As the duo juggled their flaming batons, Cannon did his best to balance Williams, effectively making him a part of the act.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW-BItOkMZM</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. He Pulls a Mime Prank on the Judges</h2><p>Showing his love for fun and friendly pranks, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cannon</a> disguised as Larry the Mime who “auditioned,” on AGT season nine. What proceeded on his fake audition was a less than stellar mime act to which all four judges buzzed and gave their “no,” votes. Larry the Mime then proceeded to rant and mock the judges for critiquing his performance before giving the big reveal.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-mULtmf-1M</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. Nick Cannon Tries Pole Dancing</h2><p>After a pole dancing act ended during season six of AGT, Cannon was seemingly tempted to try his hand at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pole dancing</a>. Although he did not have the necessary skills to pass as a decent dancer, his act was hilarious nonetheless.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVxWQYzK1CI</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. He Sings With the Contestants</h2><p>Cannon is not exactly known for his vocal prowess and does not normally sing during his appearances on TV. On this rare occasion though, Cannon was motivated by the contestants’ energy and sang “Girls Just Want To Have Fun,” by Cyndi Lauper together with them.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrJ88mJPfJY</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6. The Host Shares a Kiss With an Audience Member</h2><p>Joanna Kennedy is an intimacy expert who auditioned on season 10 of AGT, and her audition plans to teach Cannon the proper way to kiss. After Howard Stern picks a volunteer from the audience, Cannon comedically inched closer to “helping,” Kennedy on her audition.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEn1Stf4qW0</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>7. Contestants Make Music Using Nick’s Body</h2><p>Tummy Talk is not an ordinary musical act as they make music by slapping the heaviest member’s body producing a continuous beat.<a href=#> The host</a> then volunteered to have the act tried on his body, and what resulted was an incredibly funny segment.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bxPpvz3wLI</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>8. He Grinded Next to a Poetry Act</h2><p>A contestant on the show auditioned her poetry act through intimate words prompted the host to grind next to her. Nick’s actions to “add visuals,” to the act only helped the contestant to walk off the stage faster than intended.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC_fEFypY-8</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>9. He Pole Dances Again</h2><p>Cannon seemingly enjoys the act of pole dancing as he did it once again, this time together with an overweight contestant. Stern thoroughly laughed at the couple’s pole dancing act and proceeded to give tips to the “dancers.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7nGNukpFfo</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>10. Nick Cannon Becomes a Part of a Girl Group</h2><p>Singing duo act Gem City Jewels got buzzed by all four judges, Cannon revealed how much he liked their performance. He then performed together with the duo as they sang and danced their way off the stage in classic fashion.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMo82Y7wPow</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Original_CamilaCabello_Casey-DurkinNBC-220x147.jpg alt="Camila Cabello Gave Up Her Audition on ‘The Voice’ for ‘The X Factor’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570Z6knqWSmr%2BqusZmpaKbm2KworrNqKWsZZKawLV5zKiknqakqHqwuoyapJ6qmZiutHnGqKtmrJGhsq%2FAjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
