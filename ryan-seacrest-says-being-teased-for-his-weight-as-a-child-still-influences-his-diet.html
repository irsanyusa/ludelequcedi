Although this talk clearly wasn’t in the script, it was one that needed to be heard. Both hosts shared that to this day they are affected by the words their bullies said.</strong></p><p>The segment of the episode began with the two talking about healthy breakfasts and quickly took a turn. He showed a picture of his breakfast on the show. The photo included an array of different healthy foods featuring yogurt, fruits, and more that didn’t make much sense. In the photo it looked like Seacrest had also eaten turkey protein, minestrone soup, and peanut butter with honey. He shared that he doesn’t enjoy having a heavy breakfast before going to work.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ryan-seacrest-opens-up-about-how-childhood-bullying-still-affects-him-today>Ryan Seacrest Opens Up About How Childhood Bullying Still Affects Him Today</h2><p>Based off of the array of foods, Ripa gave Seacrest nutritional advice, that included information about his habits. She told Seacrest that while he tends to eat healthy, he has a few unhealthy habits. The biggest unhealthy habit she thinks he has is putting a lot of pressure on the types of food he eats. She thinks that fixating on the type of food he has leads to a shame spiral. Seacrest then defended himself by explaining how his habits with food began.</p><p>“When I was a kid I was not in the greatest of shape I was teased for it and I will always see that little boy when I look in the mirror, I cannot get past it,” Seacrest said. “I’ve talked to our experts about it but for some reason I just can’t not see that guy.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CYMZirKLgRK/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><p>Ripa completely agreed with Seacrest’s point of view. She included that getting teased as a kid often haunts people for the rest of their lives. Throughout the conversation she let Seacrest know that he isn’t alone. Seacrest noted there are two teasing memories that have always stuck with him.</p><p>“Swimming in a t-shirt or that kid, whatever his name was, in the back of the bus giving me charlie horses when I was going to school those two things stand out in my mind,” he said. “That’s how I’ve become such a fighter these days, so I can defend myself.”</p><p>Ripa shared that she also was wearing a t-shirt in the pool as a child due to bullying. She shared that her reason was lack of breasts at a young age, while Seacrest said his reason was the exact opposite.</p><p>This whole conversation definitely opens eyes to the long term effects of childhood bullying. Seacrest is 47 years old and one of the biggest names ever in television. Yet, he is still affected by something a kid said to him as a child to this day.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3.jpg alt="Nick Cannon’s ‘Wild ‘N Out’ Premiere Will Celebrate Show’s 300th Episode" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>ryan seacrest</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570bKYp2Wjmq6kvsSsq2arka7Abq7EoqWgZaSarrSxw2adqKpdnba0edaeoKCgpGKutHnAZpqhoZyZerTAyKWjZqGem7m2sc2cnKxlmJ7AbrDInqto</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
