This became Cybill Shepherd’s most memorable part. It&nbsp;brought her a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;fans and 2&nbsp;Golden Globes. It’s impossible to&nbsp;forget her wheat-blond hair, stylish outfits, and her brilliant banter with her on-screen partner, Bruce Willis.</p><p>Cybill is&nbsp;now 69&nbsp;years old, but she continues to&nbsp;play in&nbsp;<a href=# title=movies data-link=tag>movies</a>. However, none of&nbsp;her following work became as&nbsp;popular as&nbsp;her role in&nbsp;Moonlighting. On&nbsp;the photo to&nbsp;the right, you can see Cybill’s latest part in&nbsp;the 2017 movie <a href=#>Being Rose</a>.</p><p><h2>Gillian Anderson, The X-Files</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5d4/b8a/368d435283bfc94a9a92da957a.jpg><p>Thanks to&nbsp;the style of&nbsp;the FBI agent Dana Scully in&nbsp;<strong>The X-Files</strong>, red hair and a&nbsp;bob haircut became really popular in&nbsp;the 90s. The character was played by&nbsp;Gillian Anderson in&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV series and in&nbsp;2&nbsp;movies, The X-Files and The X-Files: I&nbsp;Want to&nbsp;Believe and it&nbsp;brought her worldwide fame.</p><p>In&nbsp;the 2000s, Gillian returned to&nbsp;a&nbsp;theater stage, and she also took part in&nbsp;some&nbsp;TV shows and movies.
