Which artists are on which team? Which coach is the frontrunner this season?</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-voice-season-24-teams-are-full>The Voice Season 24 Teams Are Full</h2><p>This season’s coaches include reigning champion Niall Horan, veterans Gwen Stefani and John Legend, and new coach Reba McEntire. Each coach has 14 artists on their team as they head into the Battles.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-team-reba>Team Reba</h2><p>The newest coach has put together an impressive roster of artists this season, including four talented singers who who turned all four coaches’ chairs — Jordan Rainer, Ruby Leigh, Mac Royals, and Dylan Carter.</p><p>McEntire’s team also unsurprisingly features a few country singers, including Jackson Snelling, Tom Nitti, Al Boogie, and Caitlin Quisenberry. But it’s not just country — she also has powerhouse vocalists Alison Albrecht and Ms. Monét.</p><p>Also on her team are teenagers Rachele Nguyen and Angelina Nazarian. Two artists on Team Reba who weren’t featured for very long in auditions are CORii and Crystal Nicole. We’re looking forward to hearing more from them.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-team-niall>Team Niall</h2><p>Last season’s winning coach is tied with McEntire for four-chair turns this season. He won over Alexa Wildish, Laura Williams, Nini Iris, and Huntley. Horan also has returning contestant Sophia Hoffman on his team</p><p>Team Niall also features a few acoustic singers — Reid Zingale, Noah Spencer, and Lennon VanderDoes. The youngest artists on his team are 13-year-old Julia Roome and 15-year-old Olivia Eden, who wowed the coaches with voices beyond their years.</p><p>Rounding out Team Niall are Tanner Massey, LVNDR, Brailey Lenderman, and Olivia Minogue. Could Horan win two seasons in a row? We’ll have to wait and see.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-team-gwen>Team Gwen</h2><p>Stefani is back for her first season without husband Blake Shelton, who left the show earlier this year. Like Horan and McEntire, Stefani has four four-chair turns on her team — Chechi Sarai, Rudi, Jacquie Roar, and Brandon Montel.</p><p>Team Gwen features several powerful female singers, including Joslynn Rose, Kristen Brown, Juliette Ojeda, Jenna Marquis, Kara Tenae, Claire Heilig, and Calla Prejean. The coach also has some impressive male vocalists on her team, such as Jason Arcilla, Bias, and Eli Ward.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-team-legend>Team Legend</h2><p>Legend has twice as may four-chair turns on his team as each of his fellow coaches do, with eight — Mara Justine, Ephraim Owens, Stee, Kaylee Shimizu, Lila Forde, JaRae Womack, Willie Gomez, and Caleb Sasser.</p><p>Team Legend also features the coach’s lookalike Talakai, as well as Deejay Young, Claudia B., Elizabeth Evans, Azán, and Taylor Deneen. Does Legend have an advantage? Should coaches have a limit on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">how many four-chair turns</a> they can have on their teams?
