The height of the sacred mountain is 2917 meters. According to Greek mythology, only the Gods of Olympus (or the Olympians) could live there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/695dc653678ed759.png><h3>Zeus is the supreme God of Olympus</h3><p class=align-left>Zeus is a special and unique personality. In ancient Greek religion, he is the God of heaven, thunder, and lightning. The main attributes of Zeus are a shield and a two-sided ax. He is the father of the Gods and all the people. He instilled in people a sense of justice and kindness, helped the suffering and kept traditions.</p><h3>Hera is the most powerful Goddess</h3><p class=align-left>She is the wife of Zeus. Hera is the patroness of marriages and pregnant women. She is a majestic, powerful, and gorgeous woman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4c596e66ab781f6e.jpg><h3>Poseidon is the God of the seas, fishermen, and sailors</h3><p class=align-left>After the Gods defeated the Titans, Poseidon became the lord of the water element.

Also, she leads the cycle of human life - from birth to death. Building relationships with people, Demeter "becomes their mother" and seeks to support everyone. She is altruistic, devoted to people and her own beliefs.</p><h3>Hestia is the goddess of the hearth</h3><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hestia is a maiden </a>and dislikes Aphrodite with all her might. She personifies purity, family happiness, and peace. Hestia vowed chastity and refused all suitors (even the most attractive).

Athena is the defender of the fortress walls, the warrior. She inherited strength from her father (Zeus), and wisdom from her mother (Metis).
