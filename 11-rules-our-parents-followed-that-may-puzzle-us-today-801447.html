Children were raised intuitively, very often based on&nbsp;their parents‚Äô experience. This is&nbsp;why there‚Äôs nothing surprising about the fact that many values our parents thought were immutable are actually not. And these rules really puzzle&nbsp;us today.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> looked back at&nbsp;our childhoods and made a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;things we&nbsp;now think our parents shouldn‚Äôt have tried to&nbsp;teach&nbsp;us.</p><p><h2>1. A&nbsp;college education is&nbsp;an&nbsp;indicator of&nbsp;your status.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/8f7/e90/9e7fb558bd983ff192a19d9857.jpeg><p>‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt find a&nbsp;good job without going to&nbsp;<a href=# title=college data-link=tag>college</a>!‚Äù Many people must have heard this when they were teenagers. And lots of&nbsp;us believed this but now don‚Äôt even know where our college diploma&nbsp;is. More than&nbsp;<a href=#>41%</a> of&nbsp;people that finished college have jobs that don‚Äôt require this kind of&nbsp;education. Today, employers are more interested in&nbsp;the practical skills of&nbsp;their employees rather than their qualifications.</p><p>When you finish school, it&nbsp;may be&nbsp;wise to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;gap year to&nbsp;<a href=#>understand</a> what you really want to&nbsp;do&nbsp;and decide if&nbsp;you actually need a&nbsp;college education.</p><p><h2>2. Being plump is&nbsp;healthy.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/821/463/fc852a54b3b96363014ca8cdc7.jpg><p>this is so true my grandma says this to us all the time.</p><p>Children that always finished their meals were praised, and being plump was believed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;healthy. But bad eating <a href=#>habits</a> formed in&nbsp;childhood often result in&nbsp;weight problems and eating disorders.</p><p><h2>3. Classes are good for kids‚Äô development&nbsp;‚Äî the more, the better!</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2db/3f0/c7bc635f519351a1a28f6a6d7d.jpg><p>Sure sure‚Ä¶üò≠</p><p>A&nbsp;very tight schedule can exhaust children, which is&nbsp;obviously not good at&nbsp;all.</p><p>Famous American teacher <a href=#>Douglas Haddad</a> recommends that parents slow down and give their children time to&nbsp;<a href=#>discover</a> their own talents and then decide if&nbsp;they need additional forms of&nbsp;education.</p><p><h2>4. Money can‚Äôt buy happiness.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f50/35d/fcabf75becbb3840053cba6b63.jpg><p>It can't buy love, and love makes people happy, so NO IT CAN'T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p>We&nbsp;wish this were true, but life says otherwise: money <a href=#>can</a> make you happier no&nbsp;matter what other people say.</p><p>Parents should <a href=#>teach</a> their children the basics of&nbsp;budgeting. This will help kids form the right habits in&nbsp;money management and reach financial success in&nbsp;their adult lives.</p><p><h2>5. Older children are responsible for younger ones.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2b0/a57/444b78550c96d8dff331eeaf2e.jpg><p>For real! If my sister does something bad, and I didn't watch her, I also get in trouble! I'm 10 and my sister is 8!</p><p>Very often, older children had to&nbsp;spend a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time taking care of&nbsp;younger ones. Parents had to&nbsp;work a&nbsp;lot and there was no&nbsp;other choice. But older kids had to&nbsp;sacrifice their time with friends and hobbies for the needs of&nbsp;their younger siblings.</p><p>Psychologists say that <a href=#>sometimes</a> when kids have to&nbsp;perform the duties of&nbsp;parents, it&nbsp;may lead to&nbsp;psychological problems: they might not want to&nbsp;have their own children.</p><p><h2>6. Women are housewives and men are breadwinners.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/916/661/3476d25d14b54cd79f758184af.jpg><p>I have an amazing simple example of this my mum always pushes me to help her clean the table when we have friends over even if I don't want to, to teach me how to be a good hostess the kitchen always looks overcrowded with women chatting/ helping (very inneficient) and men talking at the table.</p><p>In&nbsp;recent decades, gender roles are <a href=#>not as&nbsp;important</a> anymore. Women today can build successful careers and men can go&nbsp;on&nbsp;paternity leave and manage things around the house.</p><p><h2>7. Women have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;cook and sew, and men should know how to&nbsp;fix things.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/169/736/42d58751bda14154255be664bd.jpg><p>Some people today aren‚Äôt able to&nbsp;sew or&nbsp;make chairs, and it‚Äôs perfectly fine! Today, there are experts that you can easily hire to&nbsp;do&nbsp;anything for you professionally.</p><p><h2>8. There‚Äôs nothing more shameful for a&nbsp;woman than having children without a&nbsp;husband.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/09d/58e/c2b4d75205842b03290417706f.jpg><p>Uhhh how do they know that lady is single mum?</p><p>Wrong, again. Today, there‚Äôs nothing surprising about <a href=#>single mothers</a> and they‚Äôre not frowned upon as&nbsp;they were 30&nbsp;years ago. Very often, having a&nbsp;child without a&nbsp;husband is&nbsp;an&nbsp;informed decision made by&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman. More than that, in&nbsp;the past 30&nbsp;years, the number of&nbsp;<a href=#>single fathers</a> has increased 1.5&nbsp;times.</p><p><h2>9. Expressing your feelings is&nbsp;a&nbsp;weakness.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/00c/3e8/38ad945b4ca6b107de0c9890da.jpg><p>For some reason, people used to&nbsp;believe that expressing your feelings by&nbsp;hugging a&nbsp;child or&nbsp;praising them, for instance, could spoil them. And the result is&nbsp;not positive at&nbsp;all: generations of&nbsp;parents that didn‚Äôt get enough love from their parents <a href=#>can‚Äôt</a> give love to&nbsp;their own children.</p><p><h2>10. It‚Äôs important to&nbsp;be&nbsp;thrifty.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c9c/fa8/992d925ef0b57a4b304a408b73.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the past, when people didn‚Äôt have enough money, they required their children to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more careful with their clothes. People used to&nbsp;not use certain things before ‚Äúit&nbsp;was time.‚Äù But today, you can buy the most necessary items, even if&nbsp;you‚Äôre not a&nbsp;millionaire.</p><p><h2>11. Storks deliver babies.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/847/eb5/6f92775dda9091dc0cedb22737.jpg><p>The kids face</p><p>Some topics were never discussed&nbsp;‚Äî like when kids asked where babies came from, parents often said that they were delivered by&nbsp;a&nbsp;stork. Because of&nbsp;this, young people would often get into their first relationship without any knowledge of&nbsp;their bodies. They only based things off of&nbsp;the advice they received from their friends and bits of&nbsp;information from books and films. All these experiences <a href=#>could</a> lead to&nbsp;bad consequences, including problems with both physical and mental health.</p><p>What childhood rules became irrelevant when you grew&nbsp;up?
