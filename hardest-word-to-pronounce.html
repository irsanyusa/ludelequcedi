Learning correct pronunciation is hard in any language, but it’s especially challenging in a language like English that’s full of exceptions and contradictions—take “tough” and “though,” for example. There are many English words foreigners can’t say!
From those just learning English to the most well-read native speakers, anyone can have trouble figuring out how to pronounce certain words properly."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Anemone</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>uh-NEH-muh-nee</h3><p><strong>What it means:</strong> A soft-bodied, brightly colored sea animal that resembles a plant and sticks to a rock; also a type of garden plant</p><p>We wouldn’t blame you if you thought “anemone” was pronounced “AN-uh-moan” or “an-uh-MOAN,” due to the fact that it’s quite uncommon for a single “e” to be pronounced at the end of an English word. But the mighty anemone doesn’t play by those rules!</p><p>When I was at the beach, I saw a bright pink sea anemone trapping small fish.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Asterisk>2. Asterisk</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>A-str-uhsk</h3><p><strong>What it means: </strong>A symbol in printed text resembling a star (*)</p><p>A lot of people think this word is pronounced “asterix”—that might be because of the comic book character Astérix. But don’t get it twisted: The keyboard symbol has nothing to do with the comic strip hero.</p><p>The writer put an asterisk beside the title of her report to call the readers’ attention to a note at the bottom of the page.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Colonel>3. Colonel&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>KUR-nuhl</h3><p><strong>What it means:</strong> A high-ranking officer in the military</p><p>It might be pretty obvious why this word is often pronounced incorrectly—just look at it! Going by its arrangement of consonants and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">vowels</a>, you’d think that it has three syllables. But nope! The English exception rears its ugly head. This word is pronounced in the same way as those little seeds you use to make popcorn.&nbsp;</p><p>The colonel retired after 30 years of service in the army.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Comfortable>4. Comfortable</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>KUHMF-tr-bl</h3><p><strong>What it means:</strong> The feeling of being relaxed and having no discomfort or pain</p><p>If you split this word into two parts, you get “comfort” and “able.” Since each of those words has two syllables, then the word “comfortable” should have four, right? Well, no. It’s actually pronounced as a three-syllable word. The middle “o” might as well not even be there!</p><p>When I have guests, I like to make them comfortable by offering soft towels and luxurious bedding.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Floccinaucinihilipilification>5. Floccinaucinihilipilification</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>flaa-suh-now-suh-nai-uh-luh-pi-luh-fuh-KAY-shn</h3><p><strong>What it means: </strong>The act of calling something worthless</p><p>No list of difficult English words to pronounce would be complete without this one! “Floccinaucinihilipilification” is one of those words people use to show off their impressive vocabulary; it has the distinction of being the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">longest non-technical, non-medical word in English</a>. When you first see it, you might assume its pronunciation is—ha ha, just kidding! This one is a bit too long for most people to simply sound out.</p><p>My brother’s floccinaucinihilipilification of my rare coin collection made me really mad. They’re actually very valuable!&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Start your journey to reach fluency</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Isthmus>6. Isthmus</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>I-smuhs</h3><p><strong>What it means:</strong> A narrow piece of land connecting two larger pieces</p><p>Is-th-mus? Ith-mus? Trying to pronounce the “th” in the middle of this word probably makes you feel like you have rocks in your mouth. Luckily, you don’t have to, because the “th” is silent! Why is it there, then? Don’t ask us!</p><p>A 400-mile isthmus known as the Isthmus of Panama connects the countries of Costa Rica and Colombia.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Mischievous>7. Mischievous</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>MIS-chuh-vuhs</h3><p><strong>What it means:</strong> Playfully causing minor trouble</p><p>The funny thing about this word is that it’s mispronounced for no good reason. For some reason, it’s common for people to add an extra syllable so that it sounds like “mis-CHEEV-ee-uhs.” That second “ee” sound has no place in this word.</p><p>“I didn’t take any cookies,” said the little girl with a mischievous grin.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Otorhinolaryngologist>8. Otorhinolaryngologist</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>oh-toh-rahy-noh-luh-ring-OL-o-jist</h3><p><strong>What it means: </strong>A doctor who specializes in the treatment of the ear, nose and throat</p><p>Clocking in at 21 letters, this word is certainly a tongue twister. With a word this long, it’s always challenging to figure out which syllable to emphasize. Maybe it’s just us, but wouldn’t it be simpler to say “ear, nose and throat doctor”?</p><p>My mother is an otorhinolaryngologist at the new hospital downtown.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Sixth>9. Sixth</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Siksth</h3><p><strong>What it means: </strong>The number six in a sequence</p><p>Unfortunately, this isn’t one of those words where some letters are silent. You have to pronounce the “x” and “th” sounds consecutively, which can really trip a person up—especially if “sixth” comes before another word that begins with an “s” sound (“the sixth song,” for instance).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When I was in the sixth grade, I won the school talent show.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Synecdoche>10. Synecdoche</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>suh-NEK-duh-kee</h3><p><strong>What it means:</strong> A figure of speech in which a part is substituted for the whole</p><p>Since it contains a “ch,” it wouldn’t be unreasonable to think this word should be pronounced “sin-ek-DOCH” or something similar. Instead, the “ch” makes a “k” sound and, just as in “anemone,” it ends with a long “e” sound.</p><p>A common synecdoche is “wheels” when referring to a car. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Worcestershire>11. Worcestershire</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>WUR-stuh-shr</h3><p><strong>What it means:</strong> A tart, savory sauce typically used with meats; also, a county in England</p><p>How many syllables do you count in this word? Four? Sorry, try again! While there’s actually more than one way to say it, “Worcestershire” is typically pronounced with only three syllables. And forget that “er” sound in the middle—it might as well not even be there!</p><p>The secret to my famous beef stew is to add a few tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What do you think is the hardest word to pronounce?</h2><p>As we’ve seen, there are many hard-to-pronounce words in English. Some have sounds that are nearly impossible to get your tongue around, while others just don’t seem to make sense. The good news is that if you can learn these words, you can probably conquer any English word!<br>Are there any words we missed?
