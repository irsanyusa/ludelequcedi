Why I decided to give up smoking
I smoked my first cigarette at the age of 17, so today I can call myself smoker with 20 years of experience."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I&nbsp;barely remember any single day&nbsp;I spent without a&nbsp;cigarette. I&nbsp;really loved smoking, I&nbsp;was convinced that&nbsp;I was never going to&nbsp;give it&nbsp;up, and&nbsp;I had never even tried&nbsp;to. The only time when&nbsp;I didn’t smoke was when&nbsp;I had a&nbsp;cold.</p><p class=adme-img-description><strong>I&nbsp;had heard many stories about people who just decided to&nbsp;give up&nbsp;this bad habit and did! I&nbsp;thought that the stories were not true because&nbsp;I truly believed that the habit was stronger and too hard to&nbsp;shake.</strong></p><p class=adme-img-description>In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;get in&nbsp;shape, I&nbsp;bought a&nbsp;gym membership and realized after the first time there that&nbsp;I couldn’t breathe. I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;personal trainer which made me&nbsp;feel even more awkward since&nbsp;I couldn’t breathe after 2&nbsp;minutes on&nbsp;a&nbsp;treadmill.</p><p class=adme-img-description><strong>So&nbsp;when&nbsp;I left the gym, I&nbsp;took the new pack of&nbsp;cigarettes out of&nbsp;my&nbsp;pocket and threw it&nbsp;away. This was how my&nbsp;nicotine-free path started.</strong></p><p><h2>The first challenge</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a90/134/728ee853a8a0edf5e73bf90d69.jpg><ul readability=0.49099099099099><li readability=0><p class=adme-img-description>The first evening without cigarettes wasn’t hard: the gym took so&nbsp;much of&nbsp;the <a href=# title=energy data-link=tag>energy</a> that&nbsp;I just fell on&nbsp;the couch and fell asleep as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;I got home.</p></li><li readability=1><p class=adme-img-description>It&nbsp;was my&nbsp;first Friday without nicotine in&nbsp;20&nbsp;years. I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;work during the day, so&nbsp;I didn’t think about smoking a&nbsp;lot. But this was just the beginning.</p></li></ul><p class=adme-img-description><strong>I&nbsp;was used to&nbsp;drinking several cans of&nbsp;beer on&nbsp;Friday evenings while watching movies. But in&nbsp;order not to&nbsp;make the nicotine craving more severe, I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;give up&nbsp;drinking, too</strong>. I&nbsp;bought a&nbsp;bottle of&nbsp;Coca-Cola (equal to&nbsp;the amount of&nbsp;beer I&nbsp;drank) and turned on&nbsp;my&nbsp;favorite&nbsp;TV series. Before, I&nbsp;used to&nbsp;take breaks every 30&nbsp;minutes to&nbsp;go&nbsp;out and smoke, and now&nbsp;I was going to&nbsp;the kitchen to&nbsp;eat something healthy. But this substitution didn’t help: an&nbsp;hour later, I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;smoke so&nbsp;badly that&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;sleep.</p><p class=adme-img-description>On&nbsp;Sunday, I&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;smoke, I&nbsp;woke up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;very bad cold, so&nbsp;bad&nbsp;I couldn’t even think about food, let alone cigarettes.</p><p><h2>My&nbsp;first real week without nicotine</h2></p><ul><li>On&nbsp;Monday, I&nbsp;felt better, but the addiction kept reminding me&nbsp;about my&nbsp;craving. Because it&nbsp;became too hard to&nbsp;fight&nbsp;it, I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;buy an&nbsp;e-cigarette.</li><li>By&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;Tuesday, the e-cigarette was over. The effect was almost zero and&nbsp;I still wanted to&nbsp;smoke.</li></ul><p><h2>To motivate myself, I made a pros and cons list.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/40e/35f/4bf3ce586482f38debc5028436.jpg><ul><li>Soon, I&nbsp;just couldn’t take it&nbsp;anymore. I&nbsp;snapped on&nbsp;my&nbsp;friend and my&nbsp;cat, and&nbsp;I apologized to&nbsp;both of&nbsp;them later. By&nbsp;the end on&nbsp;Thursday, I&nbsp;was ignoring my&nbsp;<a href=# title=friends data-link=tag>friends</a>’ messages. I&nbsp;went to&nbsp;bed at&nbsp;10&nbsp;pm even though&nbsp;I was usually cooking dinner at&nbsp;this time. I&nbsp;dreamed of&nbsp;smoking.</li></ul><p>Despite the fact that&nbsp;I was having a&nbsp;really hard time by&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the week, I&nbsp;didn’t go&nbsp;out, and&nbsp;I didn’t communicate with anybody, I&nbsp;considered the first cigarette-free week can to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;success.</p><p><h2>The first month</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b79/be6/6fd0605357a42c009d24e34f2b.jpg><ul><li>The second week started with me&nbsp;smelling cigarette smoke from my&nbsp;neighbors. Before I&nbsp;quit, I&nbsp;had never noticed&nbsp;it, but now this smell made me&nbsp;want to&nbsp;throw&nbsp;up.</li><li>The fourth week was a&nbsp;holiday week and&nbsp;I was going through the hardest challenge&nbsp;— I&nbsp;had company over&nbsp;— 4&nbsp;people who wanted to&nbsp;smoke every 5&nbsp;minutes. I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;smoke with them every time but the only thing that stopped me&nbsp;— were the results&nbsp;I had already achieved. But the best thing was how&nbsp;I felt in&nbsp;the morning&nbsp;— I&nbsp;was the only person who didn’t cough and didn’t have a&nbsp;hangover.</li><li>The New Year’s resolution: I&nbsp;made a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;things&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;do&nbsp;during the holidays. It&nbsp;was the first time in&nbsp;15&nbsp;years that&nbsp;I went ice skating and skiing. My&nbsp;lungs were functioning very well. I&nbsp;could breathe easily.</li></ul><p><h2>6&nbsp;months later</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4ed/568/f13c3757aba8bf0c1a62da2cfe.jpg><p class=adme-img-description>The bicycle&nbsp;I bought with the money I&nbsp;saved.</p><p>It&nbsp;has been 6&nbsp;months. I&nbsp;rarely want to&nbsp;smoke, I’ve had beer only 2&nbsp;times in&nbsp;these 6&nbsp;months, and only one glass each time. And spending time with my&nbsp;friends has become a&nbsp;rare occasion&nbsp;— now&nbsp;I prefer doing something active, and&nbsp;I started studying Spanish again.</p><p><strong>What has changed about my&nbsp;life? Nothing in&nbsp;general</strong>. Just several things.</p><p><strong>Cons</strong>:</p><ul><li>I&nbsp;started communicating with some people less frequently. As&nbsp;it&nbsp;turns out, going to&nbsp;bars together was the only thing we&nbsp;could&nbsp;do.</li><li>It&nbsp;has become harder to&nbsp;relieve stress. Many people recommend physical exercise, but it&nbsp;doesn’t work for me&nbsp;now.</li><li>I&nbsp;have become more irritable. Maybe it&nbsp;will go&nbsp;away with time, but for now, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;what it&nbsp;is.</li><li>I&nbsp;started eating sunflower seeds which have had a&nbsp;bad effect on&nbsp;my&nbsp;teeth. But I’m going to&nbsp;lose this habit soon.</li><li>I&nbsp;drink diet coke instead of&nbsp;beer. I&nbsp;drink it&nbsp;once a&nbsp;week, on&nbsp;Fridays while watching TV. But I’m going to&nbsp;replace it&nbsp;with <a href=# title=tea data-link=tag>tea</a> (I’ve already bought a&nbsp;big cup).</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/42f/9f2/63dc5d5681bd4eb0d914222f39.jpg><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>I&nbsp;don’t have the cough that&nbsp;I had had for 10&nbsp;years. My&nbsp;lungs are as&nbsp;clean as&nbsp;they can possibly be&nbsp;after 20&nbsp;years of&nbsp;smoking and I’m very grateful to&nbsp;my&nbsp;body which&nbsp;I had been poisoning for many years.</li><li>My&nbsp;memory has improved. It’s probably because&nbsp;I stopped drinking. A&nbsp;friend&nbsp;I haven’t seen for 1.5 years told me&nbsp;that the color of&nbsp;my&nbsp;face has become better and that&nbsp;I had fewer wrinkles.</li><li>I&nbsp;spend less money and&nbsp;I used the money&nbsp;I saved to&nbsp;buy a&nbsp;bicycle: I&nbsp;used to&nbsp;spend about $100/month on&nbsp;cigarettes and alcohol.</li><li>Now, I&nbsp;can easily climb 9&nbsp;floors without getting out of&nbsp;breath. Maybe, it’s not only because&nbsp;I stopped smoking but also because I&nbsp;do more physical activity.</li></ul><p><strong>Of&nbsp;course, giving up&nbsp;smoking and drinking won’t solve all of&nbsp;your life’s problems. But it&nbsp;will definitely make you more healthy, and help you live longer.
